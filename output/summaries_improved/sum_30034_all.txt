Meanwhile, Aisyah Amini, chairperson of the Parliament's commission dealing with foreign affairs, also criticized the proposal. ``The East Timor issue is not personal affair of Suharto, but the problem of the nation,'' she said. Portugal and East Timorese pro-independence groups rejected that proposal and insisted a referendum be held inside the territory to decide its future.
