DOI INTHANON, Thailand (AP) _ Stargazers in Asia sought high ground and clear skies Tuesday to view the most spectacular celestial fireworks in 33 years, after enjoying a low-key preview Monday night. The Leonids meteor shower was expected to blaze forth in its entire glory over Asia and the Pacific after midnight and into early Wednesday, regaling millions with a heavenly display of falling stars too numerous to wish upon. Sky-watchers will get a final chance at the big show Wednesday night, after which sporadic showers may be visible for several days.
