The United States and Britain have accused Libyans Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah of blowing up a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people. The two suspects accused by the United States and Britain, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, were allegedly Libyan intelligence agents. Libya has agreed to the offer in principle, after many years of refusing to hand the suspects over for trial in Britain or the United States.
