THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A former Bosnian Muslim prison guard charged with war crimes against Serb captives should get a milder sentence because he suffers from mental problems worsened by the war, his lawyer told a U.N. tribunal Monday. The appeal came during the final phase of the months-long trial of three Muslims and a Croat accused of atrocities at the Bosnian government-run Celebici prison camp in 1992. THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Yugoslav war crimes tribunal investigators plan to return to Kosovo and resume their probe of alleged atrocities in the troubled province, a tribunal official said Wednesday.
