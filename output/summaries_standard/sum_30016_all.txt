ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair lawyers are looking at procedures for making payments of up to around dlrs 137,000 to families of those killed in last month's crash off Nova Scotia, a spokesman for the airline said Tuesday. The compensation payments correspond to Swissair's liability under its general conditions of carriage and are independent of any responsibility for the crash, spokesman Martin Kaspar said. The MD-11 airliner flying from New York to Geneva crashed Sept. 2 off the coast of Canada, killing all 229 people aboard.
