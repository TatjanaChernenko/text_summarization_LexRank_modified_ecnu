ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's government collapsed Wednesday after losing a confidence vote in parliament over a corruption scandal that tainted the prime minister with allegations of mob ties. The downfall of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and his nearly 17-month-old government could push Turkey toward another crisis between Western-oriented forces and pro-Islamic supporters. Traditionally, the job of forming a new government should go to Kutan, as his party has the largest number of seats in Parliament.
