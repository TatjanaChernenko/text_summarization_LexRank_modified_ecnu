WASHINGTON _ With just five days until money for the new fiscal year runs out, President Clinton and Congressional Democrats on Monday escalated their criticism of Republican leaders for not moving faster on the 13 spending bills needed to keep the government running. So far, Congress has completed work on only four of those bills. They say that Clinton's request for more than $13 billion in emergency spending, for matters like the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and fixing the year 2000 computer bug, are not true unforeseen emergencies and should have been included in the president's budget request.
