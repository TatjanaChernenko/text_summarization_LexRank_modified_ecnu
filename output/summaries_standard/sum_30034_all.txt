JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Assailants killed three soldiers and a civilian in the disputed territory of East Timor, Indonesia's official Antara news agency reported Sunday. Meanwhile, military officials said an Indonesian soldier was killed early Friday in Manufahi, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili, East Timor capital. Indonesia annexed East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, after invading during a 1975 civil war that broke out when Portugal colonizers left.
