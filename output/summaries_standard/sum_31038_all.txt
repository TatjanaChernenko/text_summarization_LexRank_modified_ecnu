NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Solemn-faced Kenyans whose relatives were killed in the terrorist bombing of a U.S. Embassy collected benefits on Friday they said failed to compensate for their losses. ``It's not enough, nothing could be enough,'' Beatrice Akoth Yongo, a widow with four young children and another due in December, said in the shade of a flowering jacaranda tree. Attorney-General Amos Wako, representing the government at the gathering of 100 in downtown Uhuru Park, acknowledged with regret, ``This is peanuts for someone who has died.''
