Responding to a Spanish extradition warrant, British police announced Saturday they have arrested Pinochet on allegations that he murdered an unidentified number of Spaniards in Chile between Sept. 11, 1973, the year he seized power, and Dec. 31, 1983. Scotland Yard refused to confirm Pinochet's whereabouts, but his Santiago spokesman Fernando Martinez said he was in a London clinic when police came for him. Baltasar Garzon, one of two Spanish magistrates handling probes into human rights violations in Chile and Argentina, filed a request to question Pinochet on Wednesday, a day after another judge, Manuel Garcia Castellon, filed a similar petition.
