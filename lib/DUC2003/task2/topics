     WHERE: Tripoli, Libya
     WHO:  U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan; Libyan leader Moammar

     WHEN: December, 1998

Topic Explication

     Kofi Annan went to Libya in December to appeal to the Libyan
     government to hand over suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am
     Flight 103, which killed 270 people over the Scottish town of
     Lockerbie.  Libya has resisted handing over the suspects for fear
     that they would not receive a fair trial.  The legal disputes
     surrounding this case have been going on for years; there was a
     flurry of activity in the case in late 1998 surrounding the time
     of Annan's trip.  On topic:  Stories covering any aspect of this
     trial: legal and political negotiations, criminal investigations,
     reactions from around the world to the case. NOTE:  Although the
     seminal event for this topic focuses on the trial rather than the
     crime itself, our rule of interpretation for legal/criminal cases
     extends the topic to include everything from the crime to the
     trial and sentencing.  Therefore, stories about the Lockerbie
     bombing itself (which do appear in the corpus around the 10th
     anniversary of the bombing in December) are on topic.

     financial crisis from spreading into South America.   Brazil had
     faced years of currency devaluation and severe economic recession
     despite President Cardoso's efforts at economic reform.  On
     topic:  Stories covering the negotiations surrounding the aid
     package, details of the package, reactions to the IMF's
     intervention, results or outcomes of the IMF's action in Brazil.

Seminal Event

     WHAT:  US Mid-Term Congressional Elections
     WHERE:  All 50 states in the US
     WHEN: Elections were held on November 3, 1998

Topic Explication

     The mid-term elections decided the makeup of the 106th Congress,
     involving all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 34 of
     the 100 Senate seats.  While the Republican Party (GOP) maintained
     control of both the House and Senate after this election, their
     margin of control was smaller than anticipated.  Many pundits
     linked the poor GOP performance to voter disgust over the
     Republican focus on the Lewinsky scandal. On topic: Campaign
     coverage for this election, voting analysis, reporting of results
     from all 50 states, reactions to and analysis of the surprising
     results.  NOTE: This topic is limited to the Congressional
     elections.  Coverage of voter referendums or governors' races
     (gubernatorial elections) are not, in isolation, topic-related.
     Also note that this topic is likely to overlap with Topic 3024:
     Gingrich Resigns, since the results of these mid-term
     Congressional elections were considered a motivating factor in
     Gingrich's resignation.

     evidence-gathering, investigations, arrests of suspected war
     criminals, prosecutions or trials of suspected war criminals are
     on topic.  Expansion of the Tribunal into Kosovo and its
     activities there are included in this topic as well.  NOTE:  This

     Prominent political, military and civil leaders were implicated in

     WHO: Bill Gates, Microsoft, Justice Department
     WHERE: Federal Court, Washington, DC
     WHEN: October 1997-June 7, 2000

Topic Explication


     The United States Department of justice along with 20 state
     attorneys general charged the Microsoft Corporation with
     anti-competitive practices including illegal "tying" of the
     Internet Explorer Web browser with the Windows operating system.
     The Justice Department has charged Microsoft is in violation of a
     1995 consent decree that was aimed at opening the way for more
     competition in the software industry.  Microsoft defended its
     actions by saying that integrating Internet Explorer into Windows
     is in line with its history of enhancing it's operating system.
     The Department of Justice argues that Microsoft sees the Internet
     as a threat and seeks to eliminate their internet competition by
     freely distributing their browser, integrating it into their
     popular operating system. On topic: Stories about evidence
     gathering efforts by the Justice Department and other agencies
     that led to the charges, the charges themselves, reactions,
     testimony, and discussions of the impact of the trial on the

     WHO: Osama bin Laden; 260 people killed, mostly Kenyan
     WHERE: Nairobi, Kenya and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania
     WHEN: August 27, 1998

Topic Explication

     Twin bombings occurred on August 27, 1998 at American Embassies in
     Nairobi, Kenya and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania killing 260 people,
     mostly Kenyans. It is believed that the bombings were part of an
     international effort headed by Osama bin Laden. On topic:  Any
     stories that directly discuss the bombings, investigations and/or
     the trial itself. NOTE:This topic overlaps greatly with the Osama
     bin Laden indictment topic from TDT3. The seminal event for this
     topic is the investigations of those suspected of the bombings.
     Following the rules of interpretation, on topic stories are
     stories that mention the bombing itself and the investigations and
     trial of the suspects. Articles that make reference only to the
     suspects but don't connect them either to the bombings or the
     investigations are not on topic. An example for further
     clarification: a story about Osama bin Laden and his terrorist
     organization is on-topic only if bin Laden or the organization is
     linked to the bombings or the investigations.

31041.  Philippine Airlines Closes


Seminal Event

     WHAT: Phillipine Airlines (PAL) closed
     WHO: Phillipine Airlines (PAL)
     WHERE: Phillipines
     WHEN: September 23, 1998

Topic Explication

     At midnight on September 23, 1998 Philippine Airlines (PAL) shut
     down operations, ending 52 years of uninterrupted service. The
     closing resulted from management's inability to reach a deal with
     the pilots' union. The airline's 600 pilots had been on strike
     since June 5. The ground staff also went on strike for a short
     period of a time, from July 22 through July 26. The Philippine
     tourism industry was also hit hard by the strike and temporary
     closure of PAL. Fewer tourists entered the country; moreover,
     movement between the Philippines' many islands was more difficult
     without the service of Philippine Airlines.  PAL reopened on
     October 7, after the pilots and management finally agreed on a
     contract. On topic: stories reporting the closing, the strike and
     negotiations leading up to the closing (of both the pilots and
     ground staff),  the effect on tourism of the strikes and closing,
     and the final re-opening after the contract agreement.
