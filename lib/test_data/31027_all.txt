	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators
rallied in a Tehran park Sunday to protest the rejection of scores
of candidates for the election of a powerful assembly.
	   The Council of Guardians, which is dominated by political
hard-liners, has rejected 214 candidates out of 400 who wanted to
run in Friday's election to the 86-member Assembly of Experts.
	   Many of the disqualified candidates were supporters of President
Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate. Twelve candidates withdrew
their names in protest against the screening.
	   The move by the 12-member Council of Guardians is seen as part
of the struggle between conservatives and reformists in Iran.
	   Khatami went on national television late Saturday to criticize
the selection of the candidates for the assembly, which has the
power to appoint or dismiss Iran's supreme leader.
	   ``There is no doubt that the number of wise and learned scholars
suitable for membership of the Assembly of Experts is greater than
the 400 or so candidates who have registered,'' the president said.
	   In a reference to expectations of a low turnout, Khatami said
that greater variety among the candidates would have increased
public enthusiasm for the polls.
	   Khatami said the council could be criticized for ``not creating
the climate and conditions which would have attracted eligible
individuals to enter the scene.''
	   ``We should not prevent people from criticizing the components
of the system, the institutions, the president, the Council of
Guardians, the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the judiciary,''
Khatami said.
	   The council has rejected criticism, saying its sole criteria for
judging candidates was the law. Candidates have to take a test on
Islamic theology.
	   In Tehran's Laleh Park on Sunday, thousands turned out to hear
Heshmatollah Tabarzadi, a fiery student leader who spoke of the
councilors that vetoed his own candidacy in Friday's polls.
	   ``They have created a situation where a section of society will
not be taking part in the elections because qualified candidates
have been rejected, depriving a section of society from exercising
their rights,'' Tabarzadi said.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Fearing an embarrassing low turnout in a key
election Friday, senior conservative clerics fervently urged
Iranians to vote in large numbers to show confidence in the
19-year-old Islamic regime.
	   The hard-line controlled state Tehran radio spent half its hour
long main news program Thursday broadcasting calls for people to
show their ``brave presence'' at polling stations to elect the
Assembly of Experts.
	   Besides the presidential polls, the election for the 86-member
assembly is the most important in Iran because the caucus elects
and supervises the country's supreme leader, who has the final say
in government decisions.
	   Among those urging people to vote was Grand Ayatollah Kazem
Lankarani, who called it a ``divine duty'' and warned that ``the
revolution's enemies are waiting to strike a strong blow at our
regime.''
	   Despite the urging, the lackluster election campaign has failed
to draw much excitement because of lack of competition: most of the
161 candidates _ all clergymen _ are hard-liners who were selected
by a supervisory Council of Guardians controlled by conservatives.
	   In vetting 396 aspirants, the council eliminated most supporters
of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate clergyman with wide
popular support.
	   Khatami's followers want to make the supreme leader more
accountable to the people while the hard-liners prefer a much more
hands-off approach.
	   The conflict is the latest chapter in a pervasive power struggle
in the ruling clergy between Khatami and conservative clergymen who
control most of the major state institutions such as the judiciary
and security agencies.
	   Since his elections last year, Khatami has stunned the
hard-liners with bold and popular attempts to ease social,
political and media restrictions that were imposed after the 1979
Islamic Revolution installed the government of theologians.
	   By eliminating the moderates for Friday's assembly election, the
conservatives were hoping to prevent a repeat of the stinging
defeat in 1997 presidential election when 20 million out of 30
million people voted for Khatami against a hard-line rival.
	   But then the hard-liners began to fear a low turnout would look
bad after some moderate groups decided to boycott the vote to
protest the dumping of moderate candidates as well as to call into
question the legitimacy of the conservatives.
	   Other moderates believe that people must vote to at least keep
the most stringent hard-liners out of the assembly, such as
Mohammad Yazdi, head of the judiciary, and Ahmad Jannati, head of
the Council of Guardians.
	   The moderates also do not want their candidates _ few as they
are _ to suffer because of a low turnout.
	   Candidates linked to the moderate camp include former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani and Parliament member Majid Ansari, 44, who
wants the assembly to submit regular reports of its work and to
open its sessions to public.
	   Fewer than 10 million of a little more than 38 million eligible
voters are expected to take part. Even the hard-line Abrar daily
estimated that 15 million people will vote, a turnout of 39
percent.
	   Hoping to save the day, Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
issued his final appeal Wednesday.
	   ``The people, by their huge turnout at the elections of the
Assembly of Experts will inject a new life into the revolution,''
he said.
	   Some 100,000 security forces will be deployed around the
country's 28 provinces for the voting in 33,312 polling stations.
First official results are not expected until Saturday.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians voted Friday to elect a key
assembly expected to be dominated by hard-line clergymen who favor
unhindered powers for Iran's supreme leader.
	   The state-controlled media reported an ``unprecedented and
unique'' turnout but gave no figures. However, Associated Press
reporters found many polling stations empty and others with few
voters.
	   Friday's election is for the 86-seat Assembly of Experts, whose
job is to oversee the work of the supreme leader, a post currently
held by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   In practice, the supreme leader has the final say in all matters
_ and hard-line clergymen want to keep it that way. But moderate
clerics led by President Mohammad Khatami are calling for a more
accountable leader in a political tug-of-war that has gripped Iran
since his election last year.
	   ``We want to have a say in our destiny,'' said Farhad Qaemaqami,
who waited with about 30 others to vote at a mosque in the upscale
Fereshteh neighborhood. ``I will vote for somebody who will have
some kind of influence over the (supreme) leader.''
	   But Khatami's camp appeared to have lost this battle even before
the polls: a conservative supervisory council that vetted a list of
396 prospective candidates approved 161 contestants, only about 30
of them moderates.
	   Khatami, who was among the early voters, pointed that out to
reporters after casting his ballot in the Husseinieh Jamaran
meeting hall attached to a mosque in northern Tehran.
	   ``Definitely, there could have been more qualified people than
were allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose our
favored candidates,'' said Khatami, who drove to the polling booth
dressed in the clergy's black robe and turban.
	   He shook hands and chatted with election officials before
sitting in front of a white ballot box to pick a 16-man panel for
the Tehran district from a list of 32 candidates.
	   Tehran radio said people queued in long lines to vote and
authorities expect to run out of ballot papers. ``People voted for
Islam,'' the radio said. ``People's participation is unprecedented
and unique.''
	   In Bojnourd and Astaneh Ashrafiyeh cities in the north, people
braved heavy rains and strong winds to stand in long lines at
polling stations, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
	   The upbeat reports contrasted with predictions of low voter
turnout from a disappointed public that had little to choose from,
unlike in the 1997 presidential polls when 20 million people voted
for the reformist Khatami.
	   A hard-line newspapers had said only about 39 percent of the 38
million eligible voters are expected to show up for Friday's vote.
	   ``They are all liars. I am powerless to do anything against them
so it's best to keep quiet,'' said Siavaash Mohseni, 24, a
university student who said he didn't vote. ``They have already
selected the people they want to put in the assembly.''
	   A low turnout would likely be seen as a rebuff of the hard-line
policies of Khamenei, who succeeded the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution that installed
the rule of Shiite clergy in Iran.
	   Khatami's popular efforts to ease the revolution's social,
political and media restrictions are opposed bitterly by
hard-liners loathe to give up control over Iran's judiciary,
security agencies and other key institutions.
	   Voting in the 33,312 polling stations in the country's 28
provinces is scheduled to close at 6 p.m. (1430 GMT). First
official results are not expected until Saturday.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's official media boasted about a huge
turnout in elections Friday for the council that oversees the
country's supreme leader. But many polling stations were nearly
empty in Tehran, the capital and largest city and where some voters
complained that hard-line clerics had already decided the outcome.
	   State-controlled Tehran radio reported ``unprecedented and
unique'' voting levels for the 86-member Assembly of Experts.
	   The radio said long lines of voters queued at polling stations
across the country, and electoral officers expected to run out of
ballot papers.
	   But correspondents who visited a dozen polling stations around
the capital found turnout to be minimal. Only two polling stations
had voters waiting in line.
	   The electoral authorities twice extended closing the polls for a
total of three hours. Interior Minister Abdolvahed Lari also said
late voters would not be turned away.
	   Candidate Majid Ansari, a moderate cleric, blamed the low
turnout in Tehran on the lack of choice as most of the 167
candidates _ all clergymen _ were hard-liners. The candidates were
selected by a Council of Guardians that is controlled by
conservatives.
	   ``Unfortunately, the procedures were such that competition was
limited and a group of revolutionaries were prevented from taking
part in the elections,'' Ansari told The Associated Press.
	   Ordinary people were blunt about their reason for boycotting the
polls.
	   ``It makes no difference. They have already selected the people
they want to put in the assembly,'' said Siavash Mohseni, 24, a
university student who didn't vote.
	   A young woman who gave only her first name, Arezou, said she was
also alienated from the polls.
	   ``The behavior of the Council of Guardians was very insulting
because they did not give us a chance to choose the candidates of
our choice,'' she said.
	   Although voting was supposed to be secret, there were no private
booths for voters and it was easy to see whom a person voted for.
	   An election observer in western Tehran said many voters had cast
empty ballot papers and many more had voted for supporters of the
moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
	   However, a voter in Tehran's Enqelab Square, Saeid Kazami, 41,
said he had cast his ballot mainly for hard-line candidates because
they ``are protectors of the (Islamic) revolution.''
	   ``We know that the revolution will have no problem if they are
in charge,'' he said.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a hard-liner, has
the final say in government, and conservative clerics want to keep
it that way. But moderate clerics, led by Khatami, are calling for
a more accountable leader.
	   Khatami's efforts to ease the revolution's social, political and
media restrictions are popular. But they are opposed bitterly by
hard-liners who are loathe to give up control of key institutions
such as the judiciary and the security agencies.
	   Khatami urged people to vote after casting his ballot at the
Husseinieh Jamaran mosque in northern Tehran.
	   ``Definitely, there could have been more qualified people than
were allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose our
favored candidates,'' Khatami told reporters.
	   Official results are not expected until Saturday, and Tehran's
results could be announced as late as Sunday, electoral authorities
said.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Conservative Muslim clerics were leading in
national elections for a key assembly that elects and oversees
Iran's supreme leader, according to partial results Saturday.
	   The trend offered no surprise since most of the 167 candidates
in Friday' elections were hard-liners who want to maintain the
authority of the supreme leader, the country's top Shiite cleric
who has the final say in all matters.
	   The Election Committee announced the names of winners for 17 of
the 86 seats in the Assembly of Experts. Their affiliations were
not given but judging by their background it was clear that at
least 11 of the victors are hard-liners and four are moderates. Two
are believed to be independents.
	   The committee said the 17 victors represent 12 of the country's
28 provinces. It said counting is underway for 69 remaining seats
in 16 more provinces. Final results are not expected until Sunday.
	   The elections were marked by a low turnout, and many Iranians
said they stayed away to protest the lack of choice: a conservative
council that vetted a list of 396 prospective candidates had
rejected all but about 30 moderate candidates.
	   The moderates, led by popular President Mohammad Khatami, want
to make the supreme leader more accountable to people by installing
an assembly that is more balanced in its composition.
	   They also favor greater social, political and media freedom than
allowed by the established clergy owing allegiance to supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   These theologians, who control most crucial state institutions
such as the judiciary and security agencies, cite the ideals of the
1979 Islamic Revolution that was led by Khamenei's predecessor,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Saturday that 51
percent of eligible voters cast their ballot in 12 provinces where
counting has been completed.
	   Nationwide, 40 percent of the 38.5 million electorate voted, the
independent Salam newspaper said quoting sources the Interior
Ministry. The official media on Friday claimed an ``unprecedented''
participation by voters.
	   The Election Committee said a record 64.35 percent voter turnout
was noted in Golestan province. Golestan residents, contacted by
telephone, disputed that.
	   ``The stations were empty. How those ballots got there, I have
no idea,'' said Parvin, who would only give her first name. She was
reached by telephone in Gorgan, capital of Golestan.
	   She said she visited several polling stations and found very few
people voting. Associated Press reporters who toured polling
stations in Tehran Friday also found many of them deserted.
	   An opposition Iranian group in exile, the National Council of
Resistance in Iran, claimed that only about 10 percent of the
electorate voted.
	   ``So extensive was the boycott that the ruling clerics were
speaking of religiously sanctioned rigging,'' the NCRI said in a
statement issued in Washington and faxed to The Associated Press in
Cairo, Egypt. It said authorities stuffed ballot boxes and the
regime planned to announce a turnout several times the actual
figure.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the claim and voters in
Iran did not openly complain of rigging.

	   The results were expected since most moderates had been dropped
from the ballot in advance of Friday's election by a council that
reviews candidates's eligibility and is dominated by hard-liners.
	   The hard-liners won at least 54 places on the 86-seat Assembly
of Experts and the moderates only 13.
	   Sixteen seats went to candidates whose political affiliation was
unclear _ but who probably lean toward the hard-line camp _ and
three to declared independents, who are believed to be closer the
moderates.
	   The outcome is a blow to moderates who had hoped to use the
Assembly of Experts to curb the absolute powers of the supreme
leader and broaden social and political freedoms for the average
Iranian.
	   In the capital, Tehran, moderate former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani led the polls with 1,682,882 votes. Behind him was
hard-liner Ali Meshkini, the current head of the Assembly of
Experts, with 1,240,524 votes.
	   Hard-liners won 11 of the 16 seats in Tehran and moderates only
five. Among the hard-liners who won in the capital were Mohammad
Yazdi, head of the powerful judiciary, and Ahmad Jannati, who leads
the council that vetted the candidates.
	   The results showed that only about 18 million of the 38.5
million eligible voters had bothered to cast ballots.
	   The official media had reported crowded polling stations and a
massive turnout, but visits to Tehran stations showed many nearly
empty and calls to other parts of the country produced similar
reports.
	   Many Iranians said they stayed away to protest the dropping of
most progressive theologians by the conservative-dominated Council
of Guardians. The council reviewed a list of 396 applicants and
allowed only 167 to run.
	   Friday's voter turnout was in sharp contrast to last year's
presidential elections, when some 30 million cast ballots, 20
million of whom voted for President Mohammad Khatami, who has
presented the biggest challenge to the conservatives since the 1979
Islamic revolution.
	   Some moderate leaders had said in advance they did not expect to
win the balloting but still hoped to use the assembly to focus on
the growing powers granted to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the country's top Shiite Muslim cleric.
	   The hard-liners want to maintain Khamenei's absolute authority
and have battled Khatami's efforts to grant more freedom to the
press and the arts and reduce Islamic strictures on the average
citizen.
