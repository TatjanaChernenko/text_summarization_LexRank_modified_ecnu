	   LONDON (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said the suspects in
the Lockerbie bombing are ''very happy'' to be tried in the
Netherlands, and he hoped the trial would lead to a better
relationship with the United States.
	   ''We can solve this problem very easily,'' he told the British
Broadcasting Corp. in an interview released Tuesday. ''Then the
families of the victims will be satisfied and get rid of this
anxious problem.''
	   ''When peace comes between the two countries, they will shake
hands and there will be peace. After that such acts will
automatically come to an end,'' Gadhafi said.
	   The United States and Britain have accused Libyans Abdel Basset
Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah of blowing up a Pan Am
jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people.
Both men were indicted in 1991, and the United Nations imposed
sanctions in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to hand them over. He
argued that the two would not be guaranteed a fair trial in either
Britain or the United States.
	   But after nearly a decade of deadlock, the U.N. Security Council
approved a U.S.-British plan in August for a trial of the two
Libyans in the Netherlands overseen by Scottish judges following
Scottish law.
	   Libya has accepted the idea in principle, but Gadhafi has
demanded negotiations to ensure the safety of the suspects. He also
wants the men, if convicted, to serve their sentences in Libya or
the Netherlands. Britain and the United States have refused to
negotiate.
	   Gadhafi did not discuss that obstacle in the BBC interview. But
he did seek to distance himself from the two men, who the United
States and Britain say are Libyan agents.
	   ''They may be guilty or not guilty,'' Gadhafi told the BBC.
''That is the job of the court to decide. If they are guilty, it is
because there is revenge between individual Libyans and America.
Perhaps these Libyans took their own revenge against America.''
	   Gadhafi also claimed to have evidence backing up allegations by
a former British spy that Britain plotted to kill the Libyan
leader.
	   The British government has denied using its foreign intelligence
service in any part of an assassination attempt, but Gadhafi told
the BBC, ''Yes, yes, it happened.''
	   ''Britain was behind this campaign of assassination. There is
evidence and when the time comes we will bring this evidence
forward,'' he said.
	   Last month, an Arab television company broadcast a video of what
it said was a 1996 assassination attempt against Gadhafi by British
intelligence agents.
	   The footage showed an object flying through the crowd at a rally
and landing at Gadhafi's feet. Gadhafi and his bodyguards looked
down at the object, and moved calmly away. In some of the images,
the object appeared to be a superimposed grenade.
	   David Shayler, the renegade spy who made the claim about the
assassination attempt, is currently being held in prison in Paris.
He is due in court Wednesday for an extradition hearing. If
returned to Britain, Shayler faces the prospect of being charged
under the Official Secrets Act because of his revelations about the
intelligence agency.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya has denied U.S._British allegations
that it is delaying the hand-over of two men wanted for the blowing
up of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Libya ``does not accept the claim that
it is procrastinating to gain time as the other sides claim,'' the
official Libyan news agency said Wednesday in a report received in
Cairo.
	   Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of Sate Madeline Albright and
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook accused Libya of delaying the
case and warned it would face stiffer U.N. sanctions if it did not
hand over for trial two Libyans wanted for the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103, which killed 270 people in 1988.
	   In July, the U.N. Security Council backed a U.S._British plan
for the two suspects to stand trial in the Netherlands.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who had long called for a trial
in a neutral country, accepted the proposal in principle, but
called for further negotiations and later insisted that, if
convicted, the suspects serve their sentences in a Libyan jail. The
plan calls for sentences to be served in a British prison.
	   The Libyan foreign ministry said it was astonished by the
``harmony'' between the British and U.S. statements which
``confirms Libya's warning that the British-American initiative is
nothing more than a trick.''
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force it to
hand over the defendants. The sanctions include a ban on air links
with Libya, an arms embargo and a partial ban on the sale of oil
equipment.
	   The statement said Libya had sent a legal team to the United
Nations to discuss the guarantees for the suspects in the event of
a trial in the Netherlands. It was still waiting for answers from
the parties concerned.
	   The U.N. secretariat has called for a meeting between all
parties on Nov. 9, the statement added.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Newspapers reported Wednesday that three top
Libyan officials have been tried and jailed in the Lockerbie case,
but Libyan dissidents said the reports appeared to be a political
ploy by Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
	   An Egyptian source, who like the Libyans spoke on condition of
anonymity, said he heard nothing about any such trials during
meetings with leading officials on a just-ended trip to the Libyan
capital Tripoli.
	   The reported jailing of the three officials comes as Gadhafi is
under pressure to accept a plan to turn over for trial two other
Libyans wanted for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that led to 270 deaths.
	   Two London newspapers, The Guardian and the leading Arabic daily
Al-Hayat, reported Wednesday that three top intelligence chiefs at
the time of the airliner bombing had been convicted and imprisoned
in Libya.
	   The Guardian said Abdullah al-Senussi, Musa Koussa and Mohammed
al-Misrati were sentenced to between five and seven years in prison
earlier this month.
	   Quoting ``well-placed sources,'' the Guardian said the charge
filed against the three was ``dereliction of duty'' but gave no
further details.
	   Al-Hayat's report said it had questioned Libyan Justice Minister
Mohamed Belgasim al-Zuwiy about the purported trials, but he had
replied only ``trials are going on all the time.''
	   Both the Guardian and Al-Hayat suggested that the jailing of the
three was aimed at blocking their testimony at a trial of the two
Libyan suspects which, under a plan approved by the U.N. Security
Council, would be heard by Scottish judges in the Netherlands.
	   After refusing for years to turn over the two men for trial in
the United States or Britain, Libya recently accepted in principle
the proposed trial in The Hague, Netherlands, but has delayed in
actually turning over the two suspects.
	   The two suspects accused by the United States and Britain, Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, were allegedly
Libyan intelligence agents.
	   The Libyan dissidents said the jailings were probably a total
invention leaked by Gadhafi's government.
	   One dissident said the three men had been close associates of
Gadhafi for decades and were ``too valuable for Gadhafi to dispose
of them.''
	   Al-Senousi was head of the Libyan intelligence service and
Koussa was in charge of its foreign operations during the 1988
bombing. The third man, al-Misrati, was a senior official in the
Revolutionary Committees, Gadhafi's ruling party.
	   The dissidents said Gadhafi's long resistance to turning over
the two suspects stemmed from fear that their testimony would
directly implicate his government in the bombing.
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force it to
hand over the two defendants in the Lockerbie case. The sanctions
include a ban on air links with Libya, an arms embargo and a
partial ban on the sale of oil equipment.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Wednesday that he may travel to Libya next week in hopes of closing
a deal to try two Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.
	   Annan is heading to North Africa beginning Thursday to resume a
visit cut short to deal with the Iraq crisis.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands, according to Scottish law and using
Scottish judges.
	   Because of some positive developments over the past few weeks,
``there is now a good chance that the suspects might finally be
brought'' to trial, a U.N. source said on condition of anonymity.
	   There is ``a sense of optimism,'' he said.
	   Libya had accepted the proposal in theory, but had objected to
its call for the suspects to be jailed in a Scottish prison if
found guilty. The Tripoli government has insisted that the suspects
serve any prison time in Libya or the Netherlands.
	   It wasn't immediately known if Libyan officials had indicated
some flexibility on that point, which diplomats have said was
Libya's major concern.
	   Annan said he had hoped that there would be some breakthruogh by
the end of November.
	   ``If that doesn't happen, I will be in the region next week and
the question has been raised if it would be helpful for me to go
there and bring the issue finally to closure,'' he said.
	   ``I haven't made up my mind yet, but it has not been excluded,''
he said.
	   Two Libyans, Abdel Basset Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, are
accused of planting the suitcase bomb that ripped apart the New
York-bound Pan Am jet on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people in the
air and on the ground at Lockerbie.
	   For 10 years, the United States and Britain had demanded the two
be tried in the United States or Britain, but agreed in August to a
trial in the Netherlands in hopes of finally bringing the issue to
a close.
	   The Security Council endorsed the plan and agreed to suspend
sanctions once the two men are turned over. Council members also
agreed to consider additional sanctions if Libya didn't produce the
suspects.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Louis Farrakhan, the leader of a U.S. Muslim
group, met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday and
congratulated him on his recovery from a hip injury, state-run
Libyan radio reported.
	   Improved health will enable Gadhafi to ``carry on his leading
role in the service of Islamic causes in the world,'' Farrakhan was
quoted as saying by the radio, monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp.
	   Later, state-run television showed Gadhafi _ dressed in a brown
robe and holding a cane _ meeting Farrakhan at his ceremonial tent
in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The broadcast was monitored in
Cairo.
	   Gadhafi underwent surgery last July after injuring his hip,
reportedly while exercising.
	   The visit was Farrakhan's fifth to Libya in the past three
years. The leader of the U.S.-based Nation of Islam most recently
visited in December 1997.
	   It was not immediately clear how Farrakhan arrived in Libya or
how long he would stay. Most visitors arrive by ferry from Malta or
travel overland from Egypt or Tunisia; U.N. sanctions imposed in
1992 ban air travel to and from the country.
	   Farrakhan repeatedly has urged an end to the sanctions, which
were imposed to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans
wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Citing the sanctions and U.S. regulations, the Treasury
Department prohibited Farrakhan from accepting a dlrs 250,000 prize
he was awarded by Gadhafi in September 1996 for human rights work.
The Treasury also barred his group from accepting Gadhafi's offer
of a dlrs 1 billion gift for Nation of Islam activities.


   SABRATHA, Libya _ Among majestic Roman ruins set against an
azure sea, Sebastian Cuisenier walked alone, a rare visitor to a
site that almost anywhere else in the world would be thronged with
tourists.


   ``I've always liked pariah countries,'' Cuisenier, 27, a
Frenchman from Marseilles, said when asked why he had included
Libya to a two-month journey through the region. ``And I have a
certain sympathy for people who are battling against imperialism.''


   As unlikely as it may sound, at least for now, the Libyan
authorities are trying hard to persuade more people like Cuisenier
to take the same step. It was not until three years ago that Libya
even established a Ministry of Tourism.


   Under U.N. sanctions, which prohibit international flights, the
only way to reach the country is to travel overland or by ferry.


   Since 1995, Libyan officials say they have counted 88,000
visitors, about one-third as many as arrive in neighboring Egypt in
an average month, and Western diplomats say they suspect that even
this number may be inflated.


   But Libya, which earns 96 percent of its income from oil, has
nevertheless now pronounced tourism to be ``the industry of the
21st century.'' And if real and psychological barriers could be
removed, one diplomat said, ``the potential is absolutely
stunning.''


   Scattered along Libya's 1,100-mile Mediterranean coast are
Greek, Phoenician and Roman ruins that together comprise one of the
region's richest archaeological treasures.


   Sabratha, 45 minutes west of Tripoli, the capital, was first
inhabited by the Phoenicians in the sixth century B.C. and also
boasts a Roman theater restored in the 1920s by Italian experts.


   The largest collection of ruins, at Leptis Magna, 90 minutes to
Tripoli's east, are the remains of what was once a city of 100,000
people, and are listed by the United Nations as a World Heritage
Site.


   The beaches are described by foreign residents as the cleanest
in the Mediterranean. The vast desert includes another World
Heritage Site, the oasis of Ghadames, a trading post 400 miles
south of Tripoli that was first inhabited more than 4,000 years ago
by the ancient ancestors of today's Tuareg population. In Wadi
Mathendush, in the Akarkous Mountains, rock drawings can be found
that date from neolithic times.


   Slowly, government officials say, they are making progress in
luring visitors to such sites. A crowd that gathered recently for a
cultural festival in Ghadames included the designer Pierre Cardin.


   Most tourists are retired, and many are Italians, curious about
a land that Italy colonized from 1911 to 1943, and willing to
endure the five-hour trip to Tripoli from Djerba, Tunisia, the
nearest international airport.


   Tour buses and visitors with cameras dangling from their necks
are no longer a strange site on Tripoli's streets, although both
are still scarce enough to satisfy those who have lost their
appetite for crowds.


   ``It is almost empty, and I like quiet empty places,'' said
Francois Lemaire, 63, of Vendome, France. ``What I like most is
that I know there are very few tourists here, so it means I can
have some peace.''


   Mohammed Gattus, Libya's undersecretary of tourism, said that a
recent two-day conference held in Tripoli was intended to help
train local tour operators in order to put the industry ``on a
sound foundation.''


   But as Cuisenier and others wryly pointed out, the obstacles to
travel within Libya _ particularly by independent visitors _ remain
considerable. The official exchange rate is wildly inflated, and
the government has not yet settled on a plan to establish a more
realistic rate for tourists.


   Distances are enormous, and most must be traveled by car. One
effect of the U.N. sanctions, imposed since 1992 because of Libya's
refusal to surrender suspects accused in the 1988 bombing of a Pan
Am airliner, has been to ground most of the country's domestic air
fleet.


   At the same time, the fact that tourism as a phenomenon has been
relatively recent, and that the ideology propounded by Col. Moammar
Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, declares their country is a ``state of
the masses,'' has created what Cuisenier described as ``not exactly
a service-oriented economy.''


   Still, Libyan officials say they are confident that when and if
the U.N. sanctions are lifted, tourism may indeed become big
business. And ordinary Libyans say they are resentful that
animosity from the West, and particularly from the United States,
has served to overshadow what they regard as rich attractions.


   ``My message is simple: we cannot ignore America,'' Salah
el-Fathali, the executive director of the National Cancer
Institute, said during a chance encounter as he guided two visiting
French doctors around the Sabratha site. ``But at the same time,
you cannot ignore us.''



   TRIPOLI, Libya _ Outwardly at least, nearly everything on
display in Libya these days seems calculated to project defiance.


   Posters plastered on downtown streets mock six years of U.N.
sanctions, hailing as heroes African leaders who have flown to
Libya in violation of an international ban on air travel here.


   The new backdrop for state television broadcasts is now a map of
Africa, not the Arab world, a slap at Arab neighbors accused of
being too timid to join Libya's quest to get the sanctions lifted.


   A sign affixed to the seaside Grand Hotel captures the spirit
exactly, if ungrammatically. ``Hand's Off Libya!'' it declares.


   And yet behind this stubborn facade there are indications that
the Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, might at last be close to
accepting a compromise that could bring an end to his country's
isolation, imposed for its failure to hand over two suspects wanted
in the bombing of Pam Am flight 103 over the tiny Scottish village
of Lockerbie in 1988, in which 270 were killed.


   Although he has sent mixed signals about it, Gadhafi may be
carefully weighing a deal, proposed in August by the United States
and Britain, that would require Libya to surrender the two suspects
for a trial in the Netherlands.


   Libya has agreed to the offer in principle, after many years of
refusing to hand the suspects over for trial in Britain or the
United States. But it is insisting on certain guarantees, including
a promise that the suspects would serve their sentences in the
Netherlands or Libya if convicted.


   Still, Tripoli-based diplomats say they believe that Gadhafi is
sincere in wanting to go forward with the arrangement, in part
because many ordinary Libyans have begun to get fed up with the
U.N. penalties.


   ``I'm quite sure that the Libyans want to solve the problem,'' a
Western ambassador here said. ``Perhaps at the beginning the
embargo didn't make things too hard for the regime. But over time,
I think, it's becoming harder and harder.''


   The U.N. sanctions ban only international flights to and from
Libya and the sale of arms and certain other restricted goods.
Other trade, including oil, moves freely between Libya and other
countries by road and sea.


   If Libya does not agree to the U.S.-British proposal, the
Security Council has warned that it will consider tightening
sanctions further, with measures that could include a ban on
Libya's sales of oil.


   But because backing even for the current measures is clearly
withering not only in Africa but in other countries around the
world, it is far from clear that the Security Council could make
good on that threat. That raises the possibility that even with
discomfort at home, Gadhafi may ultimately conclude that his best
option is to wait the crisis out.


   For now, though, one clear indication that Libya is acting in
earnest, diplomats say, is the government's dismissal in September
of a lawyer, Ibrahim Legwell, who for seven years headed the
suspects' defense team.


   Legwell had criticized the U.S.-British proposal as inadequate,
and in an interview in his offices here, he said that the fact that
he had been replaced reflected a desire for greater flexibility.
``It seems that the government doesn't like somebody who says no,''
he said.


   A new team of lawyers, headed by Kamel al-Makhour, traveled to
New York in October to discuss with U.N. legal officials the
arrangements for a possible trial. And in their first televised
appearance in four years, the two Libyans accused of carrying out
the bombing told the London-based Arabic-language satellite channel
MBC in October that they were ready to stand trial if their safety
was guaranteed.


   In an interview published on Oct. 18 in the Sunday Times of
London, Gadhafi was quoted as saying that he wanted to see an end
to confrontation with the West over the Lockerbie case. ``Our
people want peace,'' he said. ``They want to be friends.''


   In another interview, broadcast on Oct. 22 on the BBC, the
Libyan leader Gadhafi distanced himself from whoever may have
carried out the 1988 bombing, saying that the bombers may have been
taking ``their own revenge'' against the United States for its 1986
air and missile raid on Libya.


   At issue is the fate of the two suspects, Abdel Basset Megrahi
and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, who the United States and Britain have
said were Libyan intelligence agents. The two were indicted in 1991
after an investigation concluded that they had carried out the
bombing by planting an explosive in a suitcase.


   Their former lawyer, Legwell, said that the two men had spent
the last six years ``not in custody exactly'' but without passports
and suspended _ albeit with pay _ from their jobs with Libyan Arab
Airways.


   After Libya refused to extradite the two, Britain and the United
States successfully pushed for the U.N. sanctions, which were
imposed in 1992 and include a ban on arms sales and all
international flights. But those measures have failed to persuade
Gadhafi to hand over the suspects and, in the meantime,
international support for the sanctions has withered in some
quarters.


   Gadhafi himself has violated the flight ban on several
occasions, but the United Nations has responded with little more
than a scolding. And in the last two months, several African
leaders _ including the heads of state of Niger, Chad, Mali, the
Central African Republic, Eritrea, Gambia and Uganda _ have
defiantly traveled to Libya by plane, acts that were officially
condoned by the Organization of African Unity.


   The 22-member Arab League has been less daring, trying to serve
as an intermediary in discussions with Britain and the United
States, but choosing at a meeting last month not to flout the
sanctions. It was that decision that infuriated Gadhafi, who during
his 29 years in power has always been an ardent proponent of Arab
unity.


   Within a matter of days, the Libyan leader pronounced that ``the
Arab world is finished,'' the map of the Arab world was removed
from state television, and the government announced that it had
eliminated its Ministry of Arab Unity. This week it even advised
the Arab League that it had decided to downgrade its ``permanent''
status at the organization to that of a ``resident delegation.''


   In interviews here, Arab and Western diplomats acknowledged that
such pique underscored an unpredictability that made it impossible
to know whether Gadhafi would ultimately accept the U.S.-British
plan. But they said they believed that Gadhafi had been genuinely
surprised by the offer, extended on Aug. 24.


   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)


   nn


   Although the plan is essentially the same one Gadhafi himself
long proposed, the Libyan leader initially dismissed it as one
bound to be ridden with tricks. It calls for the two suspects to be
tried in the Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law and
promises that the U.N. sanctions will be lifted as soon as the
suspects are surrendered.


   The United States has described the offer as non-negotiable. But
the Libyan leader has raised many questions, including how the
appeals would be handled, where the suspects would be imprisoned if
convicted, and how their rights would be protected.


   Diplomats say they believe that Gadhafi is plainly concerned
that the two men will be used by prosecutors to make a case against
Libya itself, which some in the West believe had a hand in the
bombing.


   Still, they say, any Libyan reluctance to accept the deal is
almost certainly counterbalanced by worries that a refusal might
well prompt the United Nations to make good on a threat to tighten
the sanctions, which Libyans see as less and less tolerable.


   One Libyan government official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, conceded in an interview that if Libyans were asked
their frank opinion, the vast majority would say that the suspects
should be surrendered to bring an end to sanctions.


   While the sanctions do not bar Libya from selling oil, which
provides 95 percent of its export earnings, they have made life
uncomfortable.


   Sales of arms and certain other goods, including airplane parts,
are prohibited, and domestic air service within Libya _ with a
territory larger than Alaska _ has ground nearly to a halt.


   And since international air travel is also banned, Libyans who
want to travel abroad must begin their journey either by ferry, on
an overloaded vessel that makes an overnight crossing from Tripoli
to the Mediterranean island of Malta, or with an arduous overland
journey across the border into Egypt or Tunisia.
