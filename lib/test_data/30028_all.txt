	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
arrived Saturday for a one-day visit to discuss regional problems
with Saudi King Fahd and other high-ranking officials.
	   The talks will focus on the Middle East peace process and the
recent military tensions between Turkey and Syria over Turkish
allegations that Syria is harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels,
diplomats said.
	   The two leaders also will discuss the U.N. air embargo on Libya,
said the diplomats on condition of anonymity. The embargo is aimed
at forcing Libya to hand over for trial two suspects wanted for the
1988 bombing of an American jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
will go to Syria and Turkey to help cool tensions between the two
countries, which appear to be edging toward a military conflict, a
top Egyptian official said Saturday.
	   Mubarak ``will head within the next few hours to Syria and
Turkey to hold discussions,'' Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said in
Riyadh where Mubarak met with Saudi King Fahd earlier.
	   Turkey has reportedly massed troops and armored vehicles along
its border with Syria after stepping up its accusations in recent
days that Syria is supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels.
	   Syria denies sheltering the rebels and in a government statement
Saturday confirmed ``its keenness for good neighborly relations
with Turkey'' as well as its readiness to solve every issue through
``diplomatic ways, in an atmosphere of trust.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is not involved in any way in the
current, growing confrontations between Turkey and Syria, a
spokesman said Saturday.
	   ``Israel is not a part of this dispute and is not involved in it
in any way,'' said Defense Ministry spokesman Avi Benayahu.
	   Turkey has amassed troops on the border with Syria and warned of
a military confrontation following allegations that Syria is
supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels.
	   Damascus in respoonse has accused Turkey and Israel of
contriving against Syria through their increased military
cooperation.
	   Israel and Turkey signed military accords in 1996 that outline
joint defense maneuvers and grant Israel the use of Turkish air
space.
	   Israeli experts say they doubt the relations with Turkey are
such that either army would defend the other in the event of
confrontations with a third party.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ About 10,000 Turkish soldiers have crossed
into northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebels, and the government
said it might send forces into Syria to eradicate guerrilla bases
there, news reports said Saturday.
	   Turkey's incursion into northern Iraq on Friday followed two
days of airstrikes against suspected rebel bases, the daily
Hurriyet said.
	   Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in southeastern
Turkey wage cross-border raids from camps in Iraq, Iran and Syria.
The Ankara government accuses Syria of aiding the rebels, a charge
Damascus denies.
	   In an effort to ease escalating tension between Syria and
Turkey, Egypt said Saturday that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
will travel to Damascus and Ankara for talks.
	   Necati Utkan, the Turkish foreign ministry spokesman, told the
Anatolia news agency that Mubarak was expected to arrive in Ankara
on Monday. He did not elaborate.
	   The military did not return calls for comment.
	   The rebels, fighting for an autonomy in southeastern Turkey,
stage hit-and-run attacks from bases in Syria, Iraq and Iran.
	   On Friday Turkey strongly warned Syria that its ``patience was
running out,'' and Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was quoted Saturday
by the daily Hurriyet as saying, ``the soldier is awaiting an
order.''
	   But an intelligence official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Saturday that the troop deployments were not
targeting Syria, but infiltrations of Kurdish rebels.
	   Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, chief of the general staff, has
described the mounting tension with Syria as ``an undeclared war''
amid unconfirmed reports of troop deployments along the
Turkish-Syrian border by both sides.
	   According to daily Cumhuriyet on Saturday, the military has
reinforced its units near the border town of Reyhanli, with an
artillery, an engineer and an infantry battalions.
	   On Saturday, Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said Turkey would
soon carry out an exercise near the Syrian border, private NTV
television reported.
	   Turkey has never conducted wargames along the Syrian border. The
exercise was expected to follow current NATO maneuvers, running in
an area close to Syria through Oct. 21.
	   In a show of force, Turkish jets buzzed along the Syrian border
on Friday, daily Radikal reported Saturday.
	   Hurriyet newspaper said the Turkish units also sealed the escape
routes of the rebels along the Syrian-Iraqi border inside northern
Iraq.
	   Sezgin said Turkey was still trying to use diplomatic means to
solve the problem. ``But there is a limit of patience,'' NTV quoted
him as saying. ``Then we will do whatever necessary.''
	   Damascus denied the allegations and accused Turkey of plotting
with Israel to create a crisis with the aim of undermining Syria.
	   In Jerusalem, Defense Ministry spokesman Avi Benayahu said
Israel is not involved ``in any way'' in the Turkey-Syria
confrontation.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The Turkish government, which sent about
10,000 soldiers into northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebels, has

there, according to news reports.

	   Fueling tension between the two countries are Turkey and
Israel's expanding military and diplomatic ties. Syria claims the
ties are a threat to the Arab world, and on Saturday, Damascus
again accused Turkey of plotting with Israel to undermine Syria.

threats should stop,'' Mubarak told Egyptian reporters on Saturday.
``I am ready to exert every effort in this direction in Damascus

	   Turkey's Foreign Ministry said Mubarak also was expected in
Ankara, possibly on Monday.

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Tension between Turkey and Syria has risen to
the point where the top Turkish military commander says the two
hostile neighbors have reached ``a state of undeclared war.''


   ``We are trying to be patient,'' said the commander, Gen.
Huseyin Kivrikoglu, ``but that has a limit.''


   Syria has reacted angrily to Turkey's blossoming friendship with
Israel. It also makes territorial claims against Turkey and accuses
Turkey of unfairly diverting water from rivers that flow through
both countries.


   For its part, Turkey is complaining ever more loudly about
Syria's support for Kurdish insurgents in Turkey. The insurgents
are said to have bases in Syria, and their leader reportedly lives
in Damascus.


   Turkey and Syria are moving troops and equipment to border
positions, according to news reports, but no outbreak of fighting
is considered imminent.


   ``Intervention is out of the question,'' said Turkish Defense
Minister Ismet Sezgin. But he said, ``If they continue to do so
much harm, then naturally diplomacy will finish.''


   Turkish generals began issuing public warnings to Syria last
month. About the same time, during a visit to Israel, Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz dismissed Syrian contentions that Turkey and
Israel have sealed a ``satanic alliance.''


   ``I don't care about Syria's reaction,'' Yilmaz said. ``Syria's
hostile attitude is obvious.''


   Asked if military ties between Turkey and Israel are based on
shared hostility toward Syria, the prime minister replied, ``If we
are going to talk about hostility, then we need to look very
closely at Syria's support for separatist terror in Turkey.''


   Turkey's military-dominated National Security Council discussed
problems with Syria on Wednesday, and announced afterward that
Turkey was considering imposing ``economic, political and military
sanctions'' against Syria. The next day Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel asserted that Syria ``openly pursues a policy of hostility
against Turkey.''


   Syria has denied supporting Kurdish rebels. Last week the
official Syrian newspaper Al Baath said Turkey's newly assertive
position ``is a result of full coordination between Ankara and Tel
Aviv in accordance with their alliance.''


   Turkish military commanders are frustrated by their inability to
crush Kurdish guerrillas, and have for years been sending units
into northern Iraq to attack their bases. They have never sent
troops into Syria, a step that would be explosive.


   ``This could be a sign of military frustration with the civilian
government,'' said a Middle Eastern diplomat posted in Turkey.
``For a while the military was saying they had won the war and that
it was time for the civilians to step in and take over. Apparently
they weren't too happy with what the civilians did or didn't do, so
now they're taking a new tack. They want to raise the issue in
preparation for something. What it will be, they're keeping
vague.''

   In another step in its new diplomatic offensive against Kurdish
nationalism, Turkey has moved to improve its relations with Iraq.
The decision came after a deal brokered by the United States to
bring two Iraqi Kurdish leaders together last month.


   U.S. officials insisted that the deal was not intended to pave
the way for a Kurdish state within a future Iraqi federation. But
Turkish leaders were not convinced. They oppose federations or
other arrangements in which Kurds rule themselves.


   Turkey has recently suffered a series of setbacks in its
diplomatic campaign to isolate Kurdish nationalists.


   In August, local authorities in Lausanne, Switzerland, refused
Turkey's request to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the signing
of the Lausanne Treaty, which created modern Turkey, in the hall
where the treaty was signed. Kurdish groups had campaigned against
the ceremony.


   Soon afterward, a call from the guerrillas for a cease-fire won
praise in several European capitals, despite Turkey's refusal to
consider it. And last week a group called the Kurdish Parliament in
Exile has been meeting in Rome with the support of politicians from
Italy and elsewhere.


   ``Italy made a mistake,'' said Korkmaz Haktanir, a senior
foreign ministry official. ``How can a NATO member state host a
terrorist organization that threatens the unity and territorial
integrity of another NATO member state?''



   CAIRO, Egypt _ In a sign of Arab concern over growing tensions
between Turkey and Syria, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew on
short notice to Syria on Sunday in an effort to defuse what is
being portrayed in the Middle East as an unsettling crisis.


   Mubarak met with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and was
expected to renew his mediation bid on Monday by traveling to
Ankara, the Turkish capital, for meetings with top officials there.


   Turkish officials have accused Syria of allowing the country to
be used as a base for Kurdish rebels who have been fighting for
self-rule in southeastern Turkey. Official newspapers in Syria have
denied the contention and have called for talks to end the dispute,
as did the Syrian and Egyptian foreign ministers after their
meeting Sunday.


   The differences between the two countries include a territorial
dispute and arguments over Turkey's diversion of water from the two
rivers that flow into Syria.


   A military conflict between Syria and Turkey is still considered
remote, Egyptian officials said Sunday night. But a Turkish warning
that differences with Syria had reached the stage of ``undeclared
war'' has prompted worries that if clashes began, they might
spread.


   ``This is a fire that has been smoldering for a long time, but
it has now reached the point at which it wouldn't take a whole lot
more to turn it into a real blaze,'' a diplomat from Cairo said.


   In this region, at least, the situation is considered explosive
because of Turkey's new and friendlier relations with Israel. The
two countries signed a military cooperation agreement in 1996 and
have conducted several joint exercises.


   A number of Arab newspapers have suggested that Turkey's
alignment with Israel may lie behind its toughened stance toward
Syria.


   A typical editorial, published Sunday in the independent
al-Khaleej newspaper in the United Arab Emirates, said that it was
``notable that the sudden Turkish escalation has come in the
framework of the military alliance with Tel Aviv, whereby Syria is
placed between the hammer and anvil.''


   Israel, for its part, has taken pains to distance itself from
the crisis, saying it plans to scale down its military activity
along its border with Syria to signal that it is not a party to the
dispute.


   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)


   The Arab League, which last month formally condemned the
Turkish-Israeli ties, issued a statement Sunday saying that the
tensions between Turkey and Syria represented ``a blatant threat to
the security and stability of the region.'' But only Iraq among
Arab countries has explicitly criticized Turkey for the hard line
that it has taken against Syria.


   Although Turkey has repeatedly stated its willingness to accept
a diplomatic solution, its official statements have also maintained
a vaguely threatening air.


   ``I am not only warning Syria, I am warning the world,'' the
Anatolia news agency quoted President Suleyman Demirel as saying
Sunday. ``This cannot continue. We are in a position of
self-defense. The situation is serious. Turkey has suffered for
many years, and it no longer wants to suffer.''
