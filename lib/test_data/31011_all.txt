	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs headed toward southern
China Friday after battering the central and northern Philippines
with heavy winds and rain that killed at least 82 people, flattened
crops, and drove more than 100,000 people from their homes.
	   The toll was expected to rise as contacts are restored with
remote areas where roads were blocked by landslides and flooding,
and telephone service was knocked out by strong winds.
	   Among the worst-hit areas was the impoverished Bicol region
along the Philippines' eastern coast.
	   At least 53 people were killed in landslides on Catanduanes
island, where Babs first hit land Thursday, Office of Civil Defense
director Renato Arevalo said. Seventeen others died in landslides
in nearby Camarines Sur province, he said.
	   Another 102 people were injured by flying debris in Sorsogon
province, also part of the Bicol region, Arevalo said.
	   More than 100,000 people in the area were forced to flee their
homes, Red Cross officials said. Tens of thousands of others were
stranded as ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   The fatalities included six drownings, two people hit by falling
trees, two girls buried by landslides in central Iloilo province, a
man who died of shock, and a fireman crushed after his van
overturned on a slippery road, officials said.
	   In Manila, most government offices closed at noon because of the
storm. President Joseph Estrada ordered a forced evacuation of slum
dwellers living near swollen rivers.
	   About 15,700 people were removed from low-lying areas in the
capital, officials said.
	   ``Despite the situation, some people still refuse to leave their
homes to guard their meager property,'' said Jesusa Villanueva,
principal of a school being used as an evacuation center.
	   Some people, cradling chickens and dogs, stood on the roofs of
their flooded homes, a few possessions piled next to them. Others
used tire tubes to float toward safer ground.
	   Hundreds of people living along a seawall near the oceanside
U.S. Embassy were evacuated because of high waves. In suburban
Marikina, about 4,500 people living on the bank of the swollen
Marikina River were also moved to evacuation centers.
	   At least 12 domestic flights and one international flight were
canceled.
	   In northern Nueva Ecija province, more than 50 people crowded
onto the roof of a house in the town of Gapan to escape Babs'
floodwaters. About 88,000 hectares (217,000 acres) of rice were
destroyed in the province, officials said.
	   Babs also pounded areas around the Mount Pinatubo volcano with
heavy rain, unleashing 1.5 meter (5 foot) -high avalanches of
volcanic material from the mountain's slopes. Most of the material
was carried safely away by swollen rivers.
	   Late Friday, the storm was centered over the South China Sea,
140 kilometers (88 miles) west-northwest of Dagupan City in
Pangasinan province, weather officials said. It had sustained winds
of 120 kph (75 mph), with gusts up to 150 kph (94 mph), and was
headed toward southern China.
	   It was second devastating storm in the Philippines in a week.
Last week, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the
northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.

	   SAN MIGUEL, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs raced toward
southern China on Saturday, leaving behind a trail of destruction
on the Philippines' main island where at least 129 people died and
hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes.
	   Philippines President Joseph Estrada declared Catanduanes and
three other other provinces and a city in the worst hit area on the
southern tip of Luzon under a state of calamity.
	   He was expected to add more provinces to the list once the full
extent of the damage was determined. Officials in calamity zones
will be able to use emergency funds and freeze prices of
commodities with little red tape.
	   Disaster officials said the toll on lives and property would
rise as telephone service is restored and roads blocked by
landslides and flooding are reopened in the worst hit areas.
	   Typhoon Babs gained strength as it headed for southern China,
packing sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160
kph (100 mph), the Manila weather bureau said.
	   At 4 p.m. (0800 GMT), it was located about 370 kilometers (230
miles) west-northwest of Vigan in Ilocos Sur province. Moving at 11
kph (7 mph), it is expected to be 300 kilometers (187 miles)
south-southeast of Hong Kong by Sunday afternoon.
	   Of the 129 deaths reported so far in the Philippines, 67 were
attributed to landslides on Catanduanes island where Babs first
landed on Thursday, the Office of Civil Defense said.
	   ``Catanduanes received the first punch and it was a hard hit,''
said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who is overseeing the
relief and rescue work.
	   The worst landslides hit San Miguel, a coconut and
abaca-producing town along the Bato River, as residents attempted
to escape rapidly rising flood waters by climbing hills behind the
village.
	   The powerful winds flattened the abaca and tore away the leaves
of the coconut trees, making them look like giant umbrellas with
blown-away tops. Virtually every house was damaged.
	   The dead were to be buried later Saturday in two mass graves.
	   ``Entire families were killed,'' said Eddie Tapel, a local
official. ``Many children will have to quit school because their
families have no more income.''
	   Thirty other people died in landslides in nearby Camarines Sur
province and another 102 people were injured by flying debris in
Sorsogon province, both located in the impoverished Bicol region
along the Philippines' eastern coast.
	   More than 320,000 people in the area were forced out of their
homes, disaster relief officials said. Tens of thousands of others
were stranded as ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   The fatalities included 18 drownings, three people hit by
falling trees, two people electrocuted by power lines, two children
killed by a landslide in central Iloilo province, and a fireman
crushed to death after his van overturned on a slippery road,
officials said.
	   In the metropolitan Manila area, Estrada ordered at least 10,000
people living along swollen creeks and rivers out of their homes
and into government shelters.
	   Many areas in Manila and nearby provinces were still under water
early Saturday. In Pampanga province north of the capital, 35
villages in the township of Candaba were submerged, Mayor Ben Gatus
said.
	   Babs also pounded areas around Mount Pinatubo volcano with heavy
rain, unleashing 1.5-meter (5 foot) avalanches of volcanic material
from the mountain's slopes. Most of the material was carried safely
away by swollen rivers.
	   It was second devastating storm in the Philippines in a week.
Last week, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the
northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan. 	   

	   SAN MIGUEL, Philippines (AP) _ From a distance, the smashed
coconut and abaca trees scattered on the hills look like broken
matchsticks _ a painful reminder of the destruction left by Typhoon
Babs in Catanduanes.
	   The island province was the first hit by the typhoon, which
stalled directly above it for nearly 12 hours.
	   The storm drenched the hillsides, turning them into a deadly
mush that cascaded down on helpless residents seeking higher ground
from the rising floodwaters.
	   At least 69 people from the province died, most of them buried
in landslides. Throughout the Philippines, at least 129 died.
	   At the height of the storm, water in the Bato River, which
snakes through the hills of Catanduanes to the sea, rose more than
nine meters (30 feet), reaching the ceilings of some houses.
	   Most of the buildings are now roofless and many are without
walls.
	   But residents were busy Saturday repairing roofs or making
makeshift shelters where their homes once stood. Some used wire
from toppled electrical lines for hanging clothes.
	   Everyone was drying something _ furniture, mats, clothes, rice,
abaca fiber. Others scraped mud off the floors of their homes.
	   Long areas of the shoreline were choked with large and small
trees uprooted by the typhoon. The bark had been scraped clean as
they rolled down the mountains to the river and onto the sea.
	   The entire island was without electricity. A power barge that
supplied electricity to outlying towns was swept down the river and
washed out to sea by the punishing wind and waves.
	   Eddie Tapel, a provincial council member, said entire families
were killed in the landslides in San Miguel, including many of his
relatives.
	   ``Many children will have to quit school because their families
have no more income,'' he said.
	   Many people in the area rely mostly on abaca _ a type of hemp _
coconuts and fishing for their livelihood.
	   The abaca trees are now destroyed, and all that is left of most
of the coconut trees is the spindly fronds which Filipinos use to
make garden brooms.
	   ``In all my 61 years, I haven't experienced a more destructive
typhoon,'' said San Miguel Vice Mayor Alfredo Santillan.
	   The last major one, he said, struck in October 1970 but passed
through Catanduanes in a few hours.
	   That typhoon packed 275-kph (170-mph) winds and left 2,361 dead
in the northern Philippines.
	   ``We'll just have to bear it,'' Santillan said. ``We will
recover, but it will take a long while.''

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Typhoon Babs brought torrential rains and
landslides to Taiwan and lashed Hong Kong with strong winds Sunday
after killing more than 150 people in the Philippines and leaving
hundreds of thousands homeless.
	   The Central Weather Bureau said that at 3 p.m. (0700 GMT), the
typhoon was centered 120 kilometers (72 miles) southwest of Pratas
Island in the South China Sea. Packing sustained winds of 130 kph
(81 mph), Babs was moving northwest at 9 kph (5.4 mph) toward south
China.
	   Its outer fringes brought torrential rains to the whole island
of Taiwan, with Hualien and several other eastern towns recording
more than 500 millimeters (20 inches) of rain in 24 hours,
weathermen said. Authorities evacuated hundreds of people from
their homes near flooded rivers.
	   In Taipei, the main Keelung River has swelled its banks.
One-third of Hsichih town was flooded in waist-high water, and much
of nearby Wutu was also flooded. Rescuers used rubber boats and
trucks to evacuate residents from apartment blocks, officials said.
	   In eastern Ilan, a man was swept into the sea while fishing in
the rough waters. Nine people were injured when their van was hit
by rockslides in eastern Taitung, police said.
	   Several domestic airports were closed, and landslides had halted
traffic and trapped hundreds of people in mountains in central
Taiwan, they said.
	   In Hong Kong, authorities hoisted the No. 3 typhoon signal, a
warning to residents to take precautions as winds were expected to
intensify later in the day.
	   The government said it has opened up several shelters for those
seeking refuge from the storm and that more will be opened if
needed.
	   Red flags were raised at Hong Kong beaches to warn swimmers not
to enter the water because of rough seas. Fishing boats sought
shelter in the harbor.
	   In the Philippines, President Joseph Estrada has declared four
provinces and a city in the worst hit area on the southern tip of
Luzon under a state of calamity. Officials in calamity zones will
be able to use emergency funds and freeze prices of commodities
with little red tape.
	   The Philippine government's Office of Civil Defense said the
death toll from Babs has risen to 151. The fatalities included 71
people who died in landslides in hard-hit Catanduanes island and 41
people who drowned, were electrocuted or died in landslides in
nearby Camarines Sur province.
	   Local officials said entire families died in San Miguel town in
Catanduanes, where virtually every house was damaged. Residents
began burying their dead in two mass graves Saturday.
	   Nearly 400,000 people were forced out of their homes, disaster
relief officials said. Tens of thousands of others were stranded as
ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   Babs was the second devastating storm to hit the Philippines
this month. Two weeks ago, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74
people in the northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
	   Philippine weather forecasters said Sunday they were monitoring
a low pressure area over the Pacific, about 900 kilometers (558
miles) east of the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, that
could strengthen into a storm in two to three days.	   

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Typhoon Babs brought torrential rains and
landslides to Taiwan and lashed Hong Kong with strong winds Sunday
after killing at least 156 people in the Philippines and leaving
hundreds of thousands homeless.
	   The Hong Kong Observatory said that at 10 p.m. (1400 GMT), the
typhoon, packing sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph), was centered
about 300 kilometers (186 miles) southeast of the territory. It was
moving at about 10 kph (6.2 mph) toward the south China coast.
	   The storm was expected to be closest to Hong Kong on Tuesday,
the observatory said.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada on Thursday
donated 600,000 pesos (dlrs 15,000), the equivalent of his salary
for one year, to a fund for victims of recent typhoons in the
Philippines, the presidential palace said.
	   Estrada gave the money to start off a fund-raising campaign, and
asked other Filipinos to help.
	   At least two Chinese-Filipino associations immediately donated 3
million pesos (dlrs 75,000), the palace said.
	   Estrada also ordered officials of the government-run national
sweepstakes office to set up six special lotteries and donate the
proceeds to victims of the four typhoons that have ravaged the
country since September. The storms left at least 370 people dead,
more than 200,000 others homeless and millions of dollars worth of
crops and property destroyed.
	   On Wednesday, the Philippine Red Cross sought help from its
international counterparts for the victims. The international Red
Cross said it is launching an appeal for 3 million Swiss francs
(about dlrs 2.2 million) ``in urgent humanitarian assistance.''
	   The last time the Philippine Red Cross sought international help
was in 1995, when Typhoon Angela devastated the northern
Philippines. It also requested help following the eruption of Mount
Pinatubo in June 1991, and when a flash flood killed more than
6,000 people in central Ormoc City in November that year.
	   The typhoons damaged or destroyed 10.4 billion pesos (dlrs 252.8
million) worth of infrastructure, crops and other property,
according to the civil defense office.	   

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Weak consumer demand is expected to
have lowered inflation pressure on all commodity groups in the
Philippines in October, economists said Wednesday.
	   The economists said they expect October inflation to be 9.8
percent year-on-year, down from 10 percent in September. The data
is to be released Thursday.
	   In the nine months to September, inflation averaged 9.4 percent,
lower than the government's target of 10 percent for the year.
Inflation hit double-digit levels in May for the first time in
nearly two years, when it reached 10.3 percent.
	   An economic slowdown triggered by the regional financial crisis
has caused demand for most consumer items, including basic
commodities, to decline over the past few months. Food prices,
which have a hefty weighting on the consumer prices index, have
been softening since August.
	   ``With the weak economy, consumers are being very cautious with
their purchases _ and most people (are) sticking to very tight
budgets,'' said Ricky Lozari, an economist at Abacus Securities
Corp.
	   During the second quarter of the year, the country's gross
national product shrank 0.7 percent, its first contraction in five
years. Economists expect either no growth or a contraction in the
third quarter.
	   The impact of droughts caused by the El Nino weather condition,
which lowered growth in the first half, will not be reflected in
the October inflation data, economists say.
	   ``Even if some provinces are still recovering from the effects
of the drought, most major agricultural producing provinces have
since resumed normal activities,'' said Luz Lorenzo, research head
at ATR Securities Inc.
	   Lorenzo said, however, that recent typhoons could cause
inflationary pressures over the next two months.
	   The Philippines is still recovering from the effects of two
typhoons last month that destroyed some 4 billion pesos (dlrs 100
million) worth of crops. The areas hardest hit by the typhoons
account for 55 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
	   Lorenzo doesn't expect the effect of the typhoons on consumer
prices will be dramatic since the government has said it is
prepared to import basic commodities such as rice, sugar and corn
to make up for any supply shortfall.
	   ``As long as the government is ready to import, prices will
remain stable,'' she said.
	   Some economists now expect inflation to average 9.6 percent this
year, lower than the government's target of 10 percent.	   

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The price of cooking oil in the
Philippines has risen drastically this month because of retailers
speculating on a shortfall in copra production, the government said
Thursday.
	   Norberto Boceta, deputy administrator of the Philippine Coconut
Authority, said the price of cooking oil has jumped by as much as
50 percent this month from prices posted in the first quarter.
	   Boceta said in a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry
that the increase was spurred by retailers speculating on a
``perceived copra production shortfall due to the effects of El
Nino and the two super typhoons.''
	   Coconut oil is the main ingredient in cooking oil manufactured
in the Philippines. It is extracted from copra, the dried white
meat of the coconut.
	   The country's copra production is expected to drop below 2
million metric tons this year as a result of the drought brought by
the El Nino weather phenomenon, which hit coconut farms during the
latter part of 1997.
	   The two typhoons that recently hit the country, Zeb and Babs,
have also hurt coconut crops. Babs, in particular, ravaged the
Bicol region, a large coconut-producing area.
	   With hefty 1997 carry-over stocks gradually depleting, the
losses brought by El Nino and the typhoons are now affecting the
supply of copra.
	   Boceta said speculator activity also takes into account that the
last quarter of the year ordinarily is a lean harvest season.
	   But Boceta is confident that the inflated market will soon give
way to supply and demand dynamics.
	   A spokeswoman for the coconut administration office said the
price increase only affects local consumers and that the situation
is likely to normalize in a few weeks.	   


   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;


   Snow advisories were issued Thursday for the San Juan Mountains
in southeast Colorado as moist air drawn northward by a distant
upper-level low-pressure system over northern Nevada was forced to
ascend the sloping terrain. On Friday, the upper-level low will
weaken as it migrates slowly into western Montana, touching off
scattered showers in the northern Rockies and northern Great Basin.


   Farther south, isolated showers and a few thunderstorms will
develop over the southern Rockies in Arizona, New Mexico and
western Colorado as residual moist air left in the wake of the
Montana low is lifted over the mountainous terrain.


   A chilly, frosty morning over the middle Mississippi and Ohio
valleys will be followed by a sunny, mild afternoon under the
auspices of a sprawling high- pressure system centered over
southeast Missouri. The clockwise circulation of air around the
behemoth high will stretch from New England to Florida.


   Along Florida's east coast, ocean winds averaging 15 to 30 mph
will pile up water at spots along beaches, raising the risk that
dangerous rip currents will develop. Gusts to 40 mph are possible
in spots. Meanwhile, widely separated showers and thunderstorms
will form over the peninsula, fueled by inbound ocean moisture.


   Across New England, winds from the west will send milder air
eastward from the Great Lakes. However, a warm front marking the
leading edge of the advancing milder air will meet with some
resistance, paving the way for spotty showers across northern New
England.


   Focus: Stormy Philippines


   Supertyphoon Babs, armed with winds over 150 mph, slammed into
the Philippine island of Luzon on Wednesday. The fierce landfall
followed on the heels of Supertyphoon Zeb, which lashed Luzon over
a week ago. The long north-to-south span of the Philippines places
the chain squarely within the main migration route of typhoons in
the western Pacific, which boasts a higher frequency of tropical
storms than any other basin in the world. The primary reasons for
the high frequency of storms are the large expanse of very warm
water and favorably steady upper-level winds from the east.
