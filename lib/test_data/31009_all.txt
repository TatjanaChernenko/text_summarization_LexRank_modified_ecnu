	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's government collapsed Wednesday
after losing a confidence vote in parliament over a corruption
scandal that tainted the prime minister with allegations of mob
ties.

17-month-old government could push Turkey toward another crisis
between Western-oriented forces and pro-Islamic supporters.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's president began trying to
construct a new government Wednesday but the pieces do not neatly
fit: pro-Islamic forces pressing for power and their
military-backed, Western-style opponents struggling to unite.
	   President Suleyman Demirel opened talks with party leaders just
hours after the corruption-battered coalition of Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz lost a confidence vote in parliament. It was Turkey's
fourth government to collapse since 1995.
	   Demirel's meeting agenda clearly showed the potential
difficulties ahead in a nation with a growing Islamic movement but
a fiercely protected tradition of Western and secular principles.
	   One of his first meetings was with the leader of the largest
bloc in parliament: the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, which seeks
to instill greater Muslim codes and values in Turkey.
	   Traditionally, the job of forming a new government goes to the
head of parliament's largest party.
	   But Demirel is under heavy pressure from the armed forces and
secular political leaders to keep Virtue on the fringe. Such
rumblings from the military are taken seriously in Turkey, where
the generals view themselves as guardians of the Western
orientation.
	   The military has already helped push out one Islamic-led
government last year in what's been called a ``soft coup'' _ which
cleared the way for Yilmaz's coalition. And the generals have
warned they could do it again.
	   Many business leaders fear a Virtue-led government could be
another setback to Turkey's attempts to draw closer to the European
Union.
	   ``It's not very likely that Virtue will get a shot forming a
government,'' said Ilter Turan, a professor of political affairs at
Bilgi University in Istanbul.
	   Turan speculated there is a ``state of disarray and changing
ideology'' within Virtue, formed after its predecessor, Welfare,
was outlawed by the government for allegedly undermining secular
values.
	   Turan believes Virtue is in the process of trying to expand its
base beyond the urban poor and strict Muslims. Some Virtue backers
now attend functions where alcohol is consumed and women in Western
dress are among the party ranks.
	   ``They are looking ahead to the next elections,'' said Turan.
	   Virtue officials say they don't want to wait until the next
general elections in April. A senior Virtue official, Nevzat
Yalcintas, insisted the party ``must lead'' the next government.
	   On the other side, the Western-style parties may seek to suspend
their ceaseless feuds and unite in a coalition until elections. A
truce, however, is not so easy.
	   The most likely alliance, analysts say, could be led by Yilmaz
and his longtime rival, former Prime Minster Tansu Ciller. But
their animosity runs deep.
	   Also, both Yilmaz's and Mrs. Ciller's parties have been tainted
by a widening corruption scandal that includes allegations of power
abuse and links to organized crime.
	   The weight of the accusations brought down Yilmaz's nearly
17-month-old coalition in the confidence vote in parliament, where
opponents carried a convincing 314-214 margin.
	   Yilmaz has been accused of ties with organized crime and rigging
the privatization of a state-run bank by securing loans for a
businessman linked to a mafia boss. Yilmaz has denied any links to
criminal gangs.
	   He is expected to remain in power in a caretaker role until a
new government is formed.
	   The latest political reshuffling comes at a delicate time.
	   Turkey is waging an uphill fight for the extradition of Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is seeking political asylum in
Italy. The diplomatic effort and public protests have strained
Turkey's relationships with the European Union.
	   Nearly 37,000 people have been killed in the 14-year battle
between Turkish forces and Kurdish rebels seeking autonomy in
southeastern Turkey.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The head of Turkey's pro-Islamic party
said Thursday he would not insist on his rightful chance to lead
Turkey's next government, heading off a confrontation with the
military that would only deepen the nation's political crisis.
	   Parliament toppled Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's 17-month-old
government Wednesday in a no-confidence vote over a mafia scandal,
setting off a furious round of deal-making among pro-secular
parties to piece together a new governing coalition.
	   ``The no-confidence vote has dragged Turkey into grave political
chaos,'' Yilmaz declared.
	   By tradition, the job of establishing a new government should go
to the Islamic Virtue Party since it is has the most seats in
Parliament. Few believe the all-powerful, staunchly secular
military would agree to that.
	   Although Turkey's people are overwhelmingly Muslim, its
constitution mandates a strictly secular republic.
	   Within hours of the government's collapse, Virtue leader Recai
Kutan met with President Suleyman Demirel, who is charged with
picking a political leader who can command a governing majority in
Parliament.
	   ``We have told the president that we will not be insistent. It's
fine if we're in the new government. It's fine if we're not,''
Kutan said.
	   Kutan said the next administration should be a caretaker
government with the support of all parties, which would lead the
country until the next national elections.
	   Turkey's generals pressured the nation's first Islamic-led
government out of office last year, after it came to power in a
coalition with former Premier Tansu Ciller.
	   Mrs. Ciller, head of the center-right True Path Party and a key
contender for power, was meeting with Demirel later Thursday.
	   Newspapers reported that Mrs. Ciller was already in contact with
Virtue in pursuit of a possible alliance. The party denied the
reports.
	   No party has a majority in parliament. Analysts consider Mrs.
Ciller's True Path capable of fitting into any pro-secular
coalition in the political system, deeply divided by political
rivalry.
	   Turkish politics have been torn in the 1990s between the choice
of an Islamic-led government or fragile, pro-secular coalitions.
	   Even if the secular establishment succeeds in pushing aside
Virtue, it would be difficult to put together a government without
Mrs. Ciller's backing.
	   Mrs. Ciller, who commands 99 deputies in the 550-seat
parliament, declared that she would act in a ``constructive
manner'' either by being part of a coalition government or by
extending outside support to a minority government.
	   One scenario suggests she may join forces with Yilmaz, long her
rival.
	   Demirel said it would take four or five days before he completes
consultations with party leaders and designates a premier. Yilmaz,
meanwhile, serves as caretaker premier.
	   Elections are scheduled for April 18. Yilmaz has urged they be
held earlier.
	   Parliament opened an investigation Thursday into the allegations
that toppled Yilmaz _ that he had ties to Turkey's mafia and rigged
the sale of a state bank.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ One of Turkey's leading politicians warned
Sunday that a political vacuum could cripple the domestic battle to
keep Islamists at bay and in the fight abroad for the extradition
of a Kurdish rebel leader.
	   In the midst of Turkey's uphill battle to get Italy to hand over
a Kurdish rebel leader, the government collapsed Wednesday under
the weight of corruption scandals. No party has a majority to
govern alone in the deeply divided parliament.
	   Acting Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit on Sunday called on Turkey's
two center-right parties, led by arch-rivals acting Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz and former Premier Tansu Ciller, to join him in a
governing coalition.
	   ``To deal with internal and foreign questions, Turkey needs, as
soon as possible, a solid and healthy government,'' Bulent Ecevit
told reporters.
	   Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left Party, warned that the
Islamists might return to power if secular parties don't cooperate.
The military last year forced out the country's first Islamic-led
government.
	   The Islamic party, Virtue, is the largest party in parliament.
	   The military gets a chance Monday to have its say when it meets
with President Suleyman Demirel and the acting cabinet. It is up to
Demirel to name a new premier.
	   Ecevit also said a political vacuum could hamper Turkey's
campaign to get Italy to extradite Abdullah Ocalan.
	   Ocalan leads the autonomy-seeking Kurdistan Workers Party, or
PKK, which has been at war with the Turkish army in the southeast
for 14 years. Italy is refusing to extradite Ocalan because he
could face the death penalty.
	   Ocalan has asked for political asylum, which has enraged Turkey.
But Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema suggested Italy might instead
expel the rebel leader, who tried to enter Italy using a false
passport.
	   ``Asylum has to be examined with great seriousness because
Ocalan is accused of grave crimes and is accused of carrying out
terrorist acts even in Germany,'' D'Alema told Italian state
television on Saturday night.
	   Ocalan was arrested at the Rome airport on Nov. 12 after
arriving from Moscow. Turkey and Germany both have warrants out on
him.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's secular military leadership
warned a pro-Islamic party Monday against dragging the army into
politics, after its leader said the party has the backing of the
army in forming a new government
	   Recai Kutan, leader of Islamic Virtue Party, was quoted by the
daily Milliyet on Saturday as saying that they were receiving
signals that the army liked the party's new moderate tone.
	   ``It is out of question for the armed forces to express whether
it likes the tone of a political party or not,'' the general staff
said in a statement. ``Everyone should refrain from making comments
that would drag the armed forces into politics.''
	   Kutan's Virtue Party is the successor of another Islamic party,
Welfare, which was forced to step down from power by the military
last year after it tried to increase the influence of Islam in
society. Welfare was banned earlier this year for anti-secular
activities.
	   A pro-secular alliance replaced Welfare, but it collapsed last
week over corruption charges,.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish President Suleyman Demirel planned
to meet with Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit on Wednesday, stoking
speculation that he'd ask the center-left leader to form a new
government.
	   Ecevit is said to have the support of Turkey's all-powerful
military and most analysts say he is the is the most viable
replacement for Mesut Yilmaz, who was ousted in a no-confidence
vote last week over a mafia scandal.
	   Daily Milliyet said Demirel was likely to announce his choice
before leaving Thursday for a one-day trip to Romania.
	   By tradition, the leader of the largest party in parliament
would get the nod. But the largest party is Islamic Virtue, which
is opposed by the military. Last year, the military ousted Turkey's
first Islamic-led government.
	   Ecevit said he didn't want Virtue in the government and
reiterated his proposal for a new secular coalition combining his
Democratic Left party with Turkey's two center-right parties. The
coalition would have a large majority in Parliament.
	   He said Wednesday that he opposes joining forces with Virtue
because of ``our commitment to secularism without concessions.''
	   The veteran politician could act as the glue between Yilmaz and
former premier Tansu Ciller, whose long-standing political rivalry
led to a government collapse in 1996. Ecevit is said to have
Yilmaz' support, but there are doubts about Mrs. Ciller.
	   General elections are scheduled for April 18.

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The government of Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz, plagued since its inception 17 months ago by competing
pressures from Islamic groups and the rigidly secular military,
lost a vote of confidence in Parliament and fell Wednesday.


   The 314-214 vote came after Yilmaz was implicated in a
corruption scandal in which he is said to have helped gangsters buy
a state-owned bank. He has denied all charges against him.


   President Suleyman Demirel was expected to ask Yilmaz to stay on
as prime minister until an interim government can be formed to take
the country to an early election in April. But with both Turkey's
center-right and center-left parties divided by bitter rivalries,
there seemed little prospect that a stable government could emerge
from the election.


   As a result, the military is likely to retain ultimate political
power here. Its commanders view themselves as the final bulwark
against religious fundamentalism. Critics, however, say their
political role restricts the growth of democracy.


   After two years of spectacular revelations about ties between
criminals and successive Turkish governments, many Turks have
become deeply cynical about politics. Some believe that supporting
the Islamic party is the best way to show their disgust with the
political establishment. Military commanders, however, may not
allow the party to come to power even if it wins the election.


   Yilmaz had sought to ease military-backed restrictions on
Islamic symbols, which he evidently believed were too strict and
risked creating a political backlash. He urged the military to stop
insisting that female university students be forbidden to wear head
scarves, but powerful generals quickly slapped him down. Similar
conflicts are likely to afflict the next government.


   Demirel could name an interim prime minister within a few days.
According to press reports, leading candidates include Hikmet
Cetin, the speaker of parliament, and former Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit.


   During his term of office, Yilmaz managed to bring Turkey's
inflation rate down from nearly 100 percent annually to about 77
percent. Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on an
economic package for 1999 were to have begun Friday in New York,
but were canceled Wednesday. Gunes Taner, the Cabinet minister who
was to have led Turkey's delegation, was implicated in the
corruption scandal that brought down the government.


   Human rights violations continued during Yilmaz's term, but
apparently decreased steadily. The human rights organization
Amnesty International recently praised the steps he took to curb
abuses.


   Although Yilmaz was not able to push through major reforms to a
political system that many Turks believe is encrusted and
self-centered, he will be remembered as the prime minister on whose
watch the country's most-wanted fugitive was captured. The
fugitive, Abdullah Ocalan, who leads a rebel army that has been
fighting for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey, is in
custody in Italy.


   Although Yilmaz is perceived as pro-Western, Turkey's relations
with Europe deteriorated during his term. After the European Union
refused to name Turkey as a candidate for membership last year,
Yilmaz reacted with a bitterness that alienated some European
leaders. Relations seemed to be improving until the capture of
Ocalan last month. When Italian leaders refused to extradite him
for trial in Turkey, Yilmaz and other Turks accused Italy of
embracing terrorism and threatened it with an economic boycott.


   The Yilmaz government was fragile from the start, depending on
the support of Deniz Baykal, a power broker who controls a faction
in Parliament but declined to join the ruling coalition. When
Baykal withdrew his support several weeks ago, the government's
fate was sealed.


   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)


   Baykal acted after a series of charges that cast doubt on the
government's integrity. The charges stemmed from a complex scandal
that has been spreading for the last two years. It is centered
around allegations that Turkish leaders have for years maintained
ties to gangsters, using them to commit political murders and
allowing them in return to smuggle drugs and weapons.


   The charge that brought down the government Wednesday was based
on testimony from an alleged Turkish crime boss who is being held
in France. He released audiotapes suggesting that Yilmaz and Taner
helped one of his front men buy a bank from the government.


   Yilmaz was installed in June 1997 after the military pressured
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, leader of the Islamic party, into
resigning from office. But his government was not able to agree on
a strategy to counter rising Islamic influence here. Polls suggest
that if an election were held today, the Islamic party would finish
strongly and perhaps even in first place, as it did in the last
election in 1996.


   Leaders of secular parties are expected to try to patch together
an electoral alliance in the hope of heading off another victory by
the Islamic party.


   Yilmaz has said he will campaign on the strength of his
government's economic successes and its role in the capture of
Ocalan. He is also anxious to clear his name.


   ``It will be the people who will very soon make the real
judgment about our government,'' he said after Wednesday's vote.
