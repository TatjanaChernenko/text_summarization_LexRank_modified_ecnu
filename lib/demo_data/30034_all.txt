	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Assailants killed three soldiers and a
civilian in the disputed territory of East Timor, Indonesia's
official Antara news agency reported Sunday. A fourth soldier was
missing and believed killed.
	   The military blamed pro-independence activists in the stabbing
deaths Friday night of two soldiers and a civilian in Weberek, 40
kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili, the capital of East Timor.
	   Also Friday, masked men shot and killed a soldier in his home in
Leorama, west of Dili, the military said. There were no arrests.
	   The killings came after several months of relative calm in East
Timor's long-running guerrilla war, which broke out in 1975 when
Indonesian forces invaded the former Portuguese colony.
	   The head of East Timor's military, Col. Suhartono Suratman, said
two pistols that the victims in Weberek had been carrying were
missing. Another soldier who was with them was believed killed but
his body had not been found, he said.
	   Citing witness reports, Suratman alleged they were killed by
demonstrators who attended a rally organized by the Solidarity
Council of Students and Youths, a group that wants a referendum on
independence.
	   Indonesia has ruled out the demand, offering instead a measure
of autonomy in exchange for recognition of Indonesian sovereignty
and the release of jailed East Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao.
	   The army sergeant who was killed in Leorama, Josep Florindo
Pereira, had just returned home from a service at a Roman Catholic
church with his wife, Antara said.
	   Witnesses said two men shot him in the shoulder and abdomen
while he and two other congregation members counted donations
collected during the service. A total of 10 assailants had
surrounded the house of the East Timorese native, Antara added.
	   The killings occurred amid reports that the number of Indonesian
troops in East Timor was more than 20,000, far in excess of the
number claimed by the Indonesian government.
	   The Indonesian military has said there are 15,000 soldiers in
East Timor, including 5,000 troops engaged in community work such
as health care and engineering.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after intervening
in a civil war. The United Nations does not recognize Indonesian
rule and is sponsoring peace talks between Indonesia and Portugal,
the former colonial master.	   

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A U.N. envoy said Wednesday he was
making progress in his efforts to mediate a settlement between
Portugal and Indonesia on the disputed territory of East Timor,
news reports said.
	   ``Progress has been made and we'll pursue the (East) Timor issue
with great commitment,'' United Nations mediator Jamsheed Marker
was quoted as saying by the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to break the
long-standing deadlock over East Timor, was in Lisbon for three
days of talks with government officials, lawmakers and exiled East
Timorese independence activists.
	   He said he was skeptical about recent reports of an Indonesian
army offensive against a small band of pro-independence guerillas
operating out of the jungle in East Timor's interior.
	   ``From what I know from the talks I've had with the Indonesian
authorities, I think it's quite unlikely they carried out such an
action,'' Marker was quoted as saying by Lusa.
	   East Timorese opponents of Indonesia's rule claimed Sunday that
some 2,000 Indonesian troops supported by helicopters launched an
attack on the rebels. Jakarta denied the claim.
	   Portuguese officials expressed concern about the reports, saying
they could undermine confidence-building measures.
	   Indonesia invaded the territory of 800,000 people in December
1975, a few months after the departure of Portugal's colonial
administration. It annexed the territory, 1,200 miles (1,900
kilometers) east of Jakarta, a month later.
	   The resignation of authoritarian Indonesian President Suharto in
May and the democratic changes introduced under his successor, B.J.
Habibie, have brought fresh impetus to negotiations for a solution.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal and Indonesia are mulling a new
proposal to settle their dispute over East Timor, and talks between
the two sides are at a crucial stage, according to a U.N. envoy.
	   Envoy Jamsheed Marker said late Thursday that the U.N. proposal
envisages broad autonomy for the disputed Southeast Asian
territory.
	   ``We've reached a very important, and I might even say critical,
moment in the talks,'' Marker told reporters after a dinner with
President Jorge Sampaio.
	   He said the U.N. plan includes ``a proposal for very
wide-ranging autonomy for East Timor,'' a former Portuguese colony
that Indonesia invaded in 1975 and later annexed.
	   Lisbon and Jakarta have agreed to discuss the proposal which was
``couched in legal terms'' and could provide the foundation for a
future Constitution for East Timor, Marker said, though he declined
to give further details.
	   Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to mediate a settlement
on East Timor, was on the second day of a three-day visit for talks
with Portuguese officials and East Timorese exiles.
	   After the May resignation of authoritarian President Suharto,
Indonesia proposed granting some degree of autonomy to the
territory of 800,000 people, but insisted on retaining control over
its defense, economic and foreign policy.
	   Portugal and East Timorese pro-independence groups rejected that
proposal and insisted a referendum be held inside the territory to
decide its future.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military said Friday that
it was ready to act against a threat from an East Timor rebel group
to launch terrorist attacks.
	   ``We will not tolerate any activity that threatens economic or
military installations in East Timor or elsewhere in Indonesia,''
said military spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif.
	   In the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, an East Timorese group
opposed to Indonesian rule in the disputed territory said Thursday
that it was ready to resort to terrorism if Jakarta does not let
six East Timorese asylum-seekers leave the country.
	   Azancot de Menezes, the exiled Lisbon representative of the
Timor Socialist Party, said his group was ready to coordinate the
attacks with pro-independence guerrillas based inside East Timor.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, after the departure of
Portugal's colonial administration.
	   The pro-independence Timor Socialist Party wants Indonesia to
permit the departure of six East Timorese holed up in the Austrian
Embassy in Jakarta.
	   The party's secretary-general, Avelino da Silva, his wife and
two daughters ages 4 and 6, and two other East Timorese clambered
over the embassy compound's walls 14 months ago.
	   Indonesia's military have accused Da Silva and his wife of being
members of a bomb-making gang, known as the Black Brigade.
	   The group allegedly planned to blow up civilian targets in their
fight for East Timor's independence.
	   The Indonesian government has refused to let them leave the
country and says they should be prosecuted.
	   Meanwhile, military officials said an Indonesian soldier was
killed early Friday in Manufahi, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southeast of Dili, East Timor capital.
	   The military blamed pro-independence rebels in the killing of
the native East Timorese soldier, whose name was still not known.
The rebels also took his gun, said Col. Suhartono Suratman, chief
of the local military.
	   Last Friday, two soldiers and one civilian were beaten to death
by pro-independence activists in Manufahi, he said, without giving
further details.
	   In Lisbon, Jamsheed Marker, the U.N. envoy for East Timor, said
late Thursday that Portugal and Indonesia are mulling a new United
Nations proposal that envisages broad autonomy for East Timor.
	   ``We've reached a very important, and I might even say critical,
moment in the talks,'' Marker told reporters.
	   Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to mediate a settlement
on East Timor, was on the second day of a three-day visit for talks
with Portuguese officials and East Timorese exiles.

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Rebels in the disputed territory of East
Timor were holding two soldiers captive Wednesday after releasing
11 others they abducted in a deadly raid.
	   Three soldiers and one pro-independence activist were killed in
the raid Monday on a military post, in which guerrillas stole seven
guns, including some M-16 rifles.
	   Col. Tono Suratman, military chief in the former Portuguese
colony, threatened an attack on the rebels if they did not free
their captives.
	   ``If they're not released, then we will have to use force,'' he
said, adding that troops know where the rebel hideout is.
	   The soldiers were abducted in an attack by 50 rebels in
Manufahi, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili, the
capital of East Timor.
	   In recent days, four other soldiers have been killed in attacks
linked to the independence struggle in East Timor, which was
invaded by the Indonesian military in 1975.
	   On Thursday, church Masses and a march are planned to coincide
with the seventh anniversary of a massacre in which at least 50
people were killed when Indonesian troops fired on a
pro-independence protest.
	   Human rights activists claim at least 200 people were killed.
	   On Wednesday, hundreds of people staged a candlelight vigil to
commemorate the massacre anniversary.
	   Dozens of buses also brought people from outlying villagers into
Dili for Thursday's planned ceremonies.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troops
intervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days of
Portuguese rule. The United Nations still considers Portugal the
administering power.	   

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ More than 100 people held a
candlelight vigil outside the Indonesian Embassy Thursday,
demanding that President B.J. Habibie put an end to violence in
East Timor.
	   They shouted, ``Free East Timor!'' and held banners that read
``Stop Military Oppression!'' as a small group of police watched
nearby.
	   The peaceful protest in Kuala Lumpur was to commemorate the
anniversary of a 1991 massacre of anti-Indonesian protesters.
	   Seven years ago, Indonesian troops fired on pro-independence
protesters in Dili, the East Timor capital. A government report put
the death toll at 50. Human rights activists say about 200 people
were killed.
	   Earlier, a coalition of Asian activists denounced an offer by
Habibie to give East Timor some autonomy in exchange for
recognition of Jakarta's sovereignty over the region.
	   ``We call for the Habibie administration to take genuine steps
for a peaceful solution in East Timor,'' said Nadiah Bamadhaj, of
the Malaysian East Timor Solidarity Group.
	   The activists also urged the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
group to address the problem. APEC officials have begun meeting in
Kuala Lumpur ahead of the Nov. 17-18 summit.
	   ``There is still ongoing struggle in East Timor,'' said Gus
Miclat, of the Manila-based Asia-Pacific Coalition for East Timor.
``We hope the APEC leaders would address that.''
	   The coalition called for the release of the nearly 200 jailed
activists, including rebel leader Xanana Gusmao. He is serving a
20-year prison term for fighting Indonesian troops.
	   At the candlelight vigil, Miclat read aloud a message to the
protesters that he said was obtained from Xanana in prison.
	   In the letter, Xanana called Habibie's efforts ``an
unprecedented step,'' but said human rights abuses had to stop.
	   ``Jakarta must commit itself to ending the activities of its
soldiers, intelligence agents and paramilitary groups that continue
to terrorize the population,'' Xanana said.
	   Meanwhile, some 10,000 mourners gathered at a graveyard in Dili,
the provincial capital of East Timor, to lay flowers on the graves
of the dead. They lit candles as police watched from a distance.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troops
intervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days of
Portuguese rule.	   

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Stray bullets killed two villagers
during a gunfight between separatist rebels and police in the
northernmost Indonesian region of Aceh on Sunday, witnesses said.
	   A woman and a child died during the clash at Kandang village,
about five kilometers (three miles) east of Lhokseumawe, the
capital of North Aceh province, said Yacob Hamzah, a lawyer at the
local legal aid office.
	   Police and military officials were not available for comment.
	   Aceh, about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of Jakarta,
is a strongly Muslim province where rebels have been fighting
Indonesian forces for the past eight years in a bid to declare an
independent Islamic state.
	   It is one of three Indonesian provinces hit by separatist
conflicts.
	   The other two are Irian Jaya, a former Dutch colony on western
New Guinea, and the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.	   

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian legislators on Friday
chided a Portuguese effort to extradite former President Suharto,
describing the proposal as impossible and unreasonable.
	   Portugal's attorney general's office is examining a request from
lawmaker Nuno Correia da Silva that Suharto be extradited for
alleged human rights abuses committed in East Timor _ a former
Portuguese territory annexed by Indonesia in 1976.
	   Sara Pina, a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said his
office was looking at whether it's possible in Portuguese law.
	   Roestandi, a three-star general and chairman of the military
faction at Indonesia's Parliament, said such a handover would be
``impossible.''
	   ``Moreover, it is unreasonable because the East Timor issue is
an internal affair of Indonesia,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Aisyah Amini, chairperson of the Parliament's
commission dealing with foreign affairs, also criticized the
proposal.
	   ``The East Timor issue is not personal affair of Suharto, but
the problem of the nation,'' she said.
	   Suharto, 77, ruled Indonesia with an iron fist from 1966 to last
May when he was forced to quit following a wave of protests and
riots in which 1,200 people died.
	   Suharto's successor and onetime protege, President B.J. Habibie,
has offered to grant autonomy to the half-island territory in
return for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty
there.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, after
invading during a 1975 civil war that broke out when Portugal
colonizers left.
	   Indonesian troops have been accused of widespread abuses in East
Timor, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) east of Jakarta.
	   Correia da Silva of Portugal's rightist Popular Party likens the
bid to extradite Suharto with attempts in Britain to extradite
former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet to Spain on charges
that include genocide.
	   Pinochet is in London awaiting a House of Lords panel decision
on whether to extradite him.


   UNITED NATIONS _ Opponents of Indonesia's control over the
disputed territory of East Timor said Thursday that documents
leaked from the Indonesian Ministry of Defense show that the army
is not drawing down its forces in the territory as the government
has reported.


   The documents date from August, and the situation might have
changed since then. Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas, has
said several times in recent weeks that Indonesia stood by its
pledge to keep combat forces out of the territory.


   But the documents show a total of more than 12,000 Indonesian
troops assigned to East Timor, twice the number of soldiers that
Indonesia says are based there.


   They also show that the Indonesian army, known by its Indonesian
acronym Abri, counts among its numbers the members of pro-Jakarta
local youth groups, militias and public officials with ties to the
army. In the past the Indonesian government has always described
these groups as spontaneous organizations.


   The military documents put the number of people in these groups
at 9,000, bringing the total military presence to more than 21,000.


   A series of Indonesian army tables and charts were made
available to The New York Times by the East Timor Action Network, a
group that supports independence for the territory. Human rights
groups say they believe the documents are authentic. The East Timor
Action Network plans to make the documents public on Friday.


   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, a year after the former
Portuguese colony was abandoned by Lisbon. The documents cover a
period of nine months that ended in August of this year, when a new
Indonesian government announced that it had withdrawn more than
1,000 combat troops, and said that only about 6,000 defense forces
remained. None of the leaked documents track how figures may have
changed since then.


   Alatas, the foreign minister, is taking part in discussions with
the Portuguese under U.N. auspices over the future of East Timor,
which Lisbon and Jakarta agree should be given a large measure of
autonomy. The political opening provided by President B.J. Habibie,
who took over after the fall of President Suharto in May, has
resulted in rising tensions in the territory, and with them reports
of new Indonesian military movements.


   Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch Asia,
said in an interview in New York on Thursday that an increased
atmosphere of openness since May has emboldened independence forces
among the territory's 800,000 people, where calls for a referendum
on the region's future are heard more often.


   ``The government is saying that it is going to give wide-ranging
autonomy to East Timor,'' Ms. Jones said in New York. ``But at the
same time it is beginning to use the term autonomy as synonymous
with pro-integration, because autonomy means that you accept
Indonesian sovereignty.''


   ``The resistance and pro-independence forces in East Timor are
not only making themselves much more visible than ever before but
also challenging that concept of autonomy much more openly than
ever before.''


   ``So what used to be the clash between the pro-integration and
anti-integration forces has become widespread tension as a result
of differences over support for a referendum _ which is clearly the
popular option _ and support for autonomy, which is clearly the
government position,'' Ms. Jones said.


   In Washington, a State Department official said that the United
States has not been able to confirm reports that more Indonesian
troops are going to East Timor, but that it has also not been able
to verify how many were withdrawn in the summer. ``How you count
people makes a big difference,'' the official said.


   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)


   George Aditjondro, an Indonesian human rights activist who
teaches the sociology of corruption at Newcastle University in
Australia, where he has documented the wealth of the Suharto
family, said on Thursday that he is certain that ``the documents
came from Cilangkap, Indonesia's Pentagon,'' and that they are very
revealing because of how they count people.


   ``They tell us that the number of soldiers in the field is
nearly twice the number officially mentioned,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Chicago, where he is attending a
conference.


   ``The second thing is that maybe these are the first documents
that put the paramilitary units, the counterinsurgency units, on
Abri's payroll,'' Aditjondro said. ``The government previously
called them spontaneous youth groups wanting to defend the
integration of East Timor.''


   He added that the documents show that ``the presence of the
Indonesian state in East Timor is heavily militarized.''



   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia's National Commission on Human
Rights will investigate accusations that soldiers executed as many
as 50 people this month in the troubled province of East Timor in a
military operation against armed rebels, the government said
Tuesday.


   Marzuki Darusman, the commission's vice president, said a senior
commission member would investigate allegations of the executions
and of arbitrary arrests by the armed forces between Nov. 10 and
Nov. 16 in the subdistrict of Alas on East Timor's southern coast.


   He said the investigator would be Clementino Dos Reis Amaral, a
commission member from East Timor.


   Citing ``very reliable sources,'' the former Portuguese governor
of East Timor, Mario Carrascalao, said Tuesday that he has been
told that 42 people had been executed and more than 40 wounded and
that 200 others were missing in the Alas area.


   Carrascalao, speaking in Jakarta, said he was willing to go
himself to help investigate the allegations. He said the area where
the killings were reported was also a site for resettlement of
Javanese under a contentious government program.


   ``I'd like to know the real truth about what happened,'' he
said.


   The International Committee of the Red Cross said Tuesday that a
team it sent to the area had found ``no confirmation of large-scale
atrocities.''


   Portugal, the former colonial ruler of East Timor, suspended
U.N.-brokered talks with Indonesia in New York on Friday after
receiving the first reports that civilians had been killed in an
area where guerrillas are active. Carrascalao said the talks were
to resume today.


   East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed the
following year in a move never recognized by the United Nations.


   In the East Timor capital, Dili, as many as 2,000 East Timorese
students continue to occupy the local parliament building in
protest against the alleged killings by the Indonesian troops.


   The Australian-based East Timor Human Rights Center, considered
the main watchdog group for East Timorese rights, issued a
statement Tuesday accusing the Indonesian military of executing 50
East Timorese and arresting 30 others, including two teen-age
girls. It said it had identified 14 of those killed and expressed
grave fears for the safety of the detainees.


   ``The killings and arrests in the Alas subdistrict have followed
the recent buildup of Indonesian troops in the area,'' the report
said, adding that the alleged killings may have been in retaliation
for an attack on the troops by rebels of the East Timorese Armed
Resistance in which three Indonesian soldiers were killed and 13
captured.


   The report said that following the rebel attack on Nov. 9,
troops attacked a village on Nov. 13, arresting and later killing
the chief and four other people.


   A report in the Dili-based newspaper Suara Timor Timur quotes
the Indonesian military chief of East Timor, Col. Tono Suratman, as
confirming the death of the chief, Vicente Xavier, and calling him
a ringleader of the rebel attacks.
